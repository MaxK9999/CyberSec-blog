All ports are a bust, we could try to brute force SSH or try out PostgreSQL first.


## 5437/TCP - PostgreSQL

We check out the options for running `psql`:

We connect succesfully using the first found creds.

In order to list databases we issue the `\l` command.

It looks like there's nothing interesting. Let's check the version number and find out whether there's any **authenticated exploits** available.

It seems we've found something.

Good, this seems to fit our use case.

I then visited the authors mentioned [GitHub page](https://github.com/b4keSn4ke/CVE-2019-9193) to read more into the found vulnerability:

I downloaded the PoC and ran it:

Looks like it worked like a charm.

I even found out what user had the `local.txt` flag in his directory.

Unfortunately he didn't have any `.ssh` keys so we had to use a reverse shell instead.

# Privilege Escalation

I downloaded over `linpeas` and let it run.

![](../../../assets/94fea8d1ab9d3ddc60cbc382b64f0e79.png)

This suggested that the `find` binary would HIGHLY LIKELY be a PE vector

![](../../../assets/e5fb1c0a02635334e2a65cff7b04c5fe.png)

I then used GTFObins to find the binary and how to exploit it. 

![](../../../assets/dc64087bf9193a94166868bdb6a55e9e.png)

Turns out that since the SUID bit is set we can just run the following and get a root shell:

```bash
/usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```

>[!summary]
>We utilized an exploit to get RCE using the **PostgreSQL** service which is outdated.
>After gaining a foothold we took advantage of the SUID bit that was set on the `find` binary to get `root` RCE.
