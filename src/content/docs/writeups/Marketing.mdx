## Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap 192.168.195.225 -T5 -vvvv --min-rate=5000 -sT -p-

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

I add the host to my `/etc/hosts` file and get to work.


## Gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://marketing.pg -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php,config,zip,pdf
```

This yielded the `/old` endpoint which looked exactly the same as the current one.

*Except* for this part:

![](../../../assets/478d2abdbac77953841ac7874f0f9517.png)

Here we could click the link and check it out. Upon clicking it we get redirected:

![](../../../assets/bfcf84a535e0b0ae31abd6680685ccc5.png)

I then reran gobuster in order to enumerate the new domain.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://customers-survey.marketing.pg -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php,config,zip,pdf
```

This yielded significantly more results.


# Initial Foothold

## 80/TCP - HTTP

The main page had nothing significant but I found some LIKELY user data from the `/about-us.html` endpoint.

![](../../../assets/ceb211f2d3021dc40778f41111829067.png)

We can go ahead and enumerate whether these users exist on SSH and try to log in with a password list using `hydra`.

![](../../../assets/70ff07295ae46feabf980c8f28030847.png)

While Hydra was running I checked out the new domain again.

>[!note]
>Hydra got no results.

![](../../../assets/373f01690cf16403f65ce2216de68c64.png)

From here (according to our gobuster enumeration) we can head to `/admin` for the login page.

![](../../../assets/deced7d5995c9ef1a70e88ef3da9be2a.png)

![](../../../assets/b3072fc984fc0586b64127877fc82538.png)

I looked for **LimeSurvey default passwords** and found a link:

![](../../../assets/ec412b743b9883442165533678182da2.png)

```
admin - password
```

![](../../../assets/19a8141f9d62bbd281b80637d772247b.png)

It worked!

But more importantly:

![](../../../assets/af9bff398e46b2019700f062ff0cadce.png)

While uncertain if it would work I did find a PoC that could give us RCE:

![](../../../assets/c4a18b8f4f1c10e1257deac2cf1f1f18.png)

Let's check the exploit and modify it.

The author has a GitHub page for the PoC where they explain the steps in detail:

![](../../../assets/b7a6fb0e332aa93447359e2240199ed7.png)

>[!info]
>I tried the automatic exploit but it wouldn't fire, instead I tried the manual approach.

![](../../../assets/b34db61cc52d3607782279f25d69b895.png)

I then used the plugin upload to upload the zip file:

![](../../../assets/8fd841a040e681c1e8da4e253664de0e.png)

![](../../../assets/2c7f0a7f53f4fb5e5793a5715eb0b215.png)
![](../../../assets/1a92a3fa64b6f3d13521c2f58c00cf38.png)

We could now go ahead and start it up.

![](../../../assets/b5854f4103853724164a10421ec69c24.png)

![](../../../assets/221dd9e70a7b44fcb1c3752013f75919.png)

![](../../../assets/d1c3a24591ff7514857a1685c791c018.png)

Here we got 2 users, *m.sander* and *t.miller*.

![](../../../assets/022f2845fc4d7f8b435cca0f354d16c8.png)

We need to log in as t.miller in order to `cat` the `local.txt` file.


## Enumeration

In order to gain privileges I downloaded linpeas and ran it. The first thing that popped up was:

![](../../../assets/7cc66025d08466ea64c420009e76913a.png)

Then upon further analyzing I also found the following noteworthy stuff:

![](../../../assets/6f44d534ae45b7ae2022fbda3e61abad.png)

![](../../../assets/86c87f7c21f0cff21f621bda56fdb6c1.png)

![](../../../assets/463a4675381d3bd8c3786d15e4f1a631.png)

Bingo!
Let's check the file:

![](../../../assets/927ab17355a27e4b5eff48416d311576.png)

```
limesurvey_user
EzPwz2022_dev1$$23!!
```

I could now go ahead and access the **MySQL** server.


## MySQL

![](../../../assets/706d9342d21bae94c5ac3be09231dcbc.png)

![](../../../assets/f444e1b265140d1a2ae729e3bc84d7b2.png)

```

![](../../../assets/02fae5566c326b840297e82a2528e46f.png)

![](../../../assets/383d782597db6581c66bab3c0b689a2c.png)

Let's crack it:

```bash
hashcat -m 3200 sql.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
```

![](../../../assets/8b0f7ffcd5a45ea2b7664b74f5bc7695.png)

Yeah it's the same password as previously.

>[!note]
>At this point I figured to try out logging in with the MySQL password into `t.miller`'s account.

### local.txt

Ez PZ. Let's upgrade our shell to a SSH shell.

![](../../../assets/66e218465bc239e3eabfa7136d0a7831.png)


# Privilege Escalation

I enumerated the environment once more using `sudo -l` and found the following:

![](../../../assets/6ac41026c55605f68d229b5c1e944d5a.png)

![](../../../assets/ef46de7430be5bffdd747c540730bab8.png)

We can run `/usr/bin/sync.sh` as *m.sander*. 

>[!info]
>This is just a script that compares *m.sander*'s notes in his personal folder, since we cannot access it we need to find something else.

After some enumeration using `id` I found out we're part of the `mlocate` group.

![](../../../assets/7bafdb3963bddfef8c896596fbabfb31.png)

Accordingly I looked for any files matching this description:

![](../../../assets/5584866c336e28e114852fdf0af0f6c3.png)

![](../../../assets/dc8b33e2ab4f014fe7d61fa7e1637355.png)

Nothing in the cron job.

I checked the `mlocate.db` file but that is hugeeee, meaning we might be able to grep it.

>[!note]
>I was in fact *NOT* able to grep it.

I went ahead and downloaded the file over using `scp`:

```bash
scp t.miller@192.168.195.225:/home/t.miller/mlocate.db mlocate.db
```

Finally after a long while I found something that looked a bit useful:

![](../../../assets/4675028b881974e8758d54b2bca04b88.png)

>[!danger]
>Only with the help of a walkthrough was I able to figure out wtf I was supposed to from here.

I issued the following commands to create a **Symlink** and then used the binary to compare the two:

![](../../../assets/48406ec7a7c9d8a6c837a650dd42dcec.png)

Now we can try to `su` to michael's account:

![](../../../assets/f30a71d5ea7b250e86311e0f98420e00.png)

After trying out all three the last one worked.

![](../../../assets/3cda51be22f0339bd4d87c29dd83354f.png)

Thank god we had ALL permissions.
