## 21/TCP - FTP

![](../../../assets/714ef66058b91195132748f960864589.png)

There's nothing here but this could be potentially a directory where we can upload scripts since it is allowed.

Moving on for now though

## 80/TCP - HTTP

We found a `robots.txt` file in the `nmap` scan:

![](../../../assets/70ed315645ee82e6c7033e78c0baf805.png)

I also found a login page but had no credentials to log in so I looked at the **Redis** port as this could LIKELY be a rabbithole.

## 6379/TCP - Redis

![](../../../assets/9a102e46574a323696f6ffd21c629b1c.png)

I have already exploited **Redis** previously and tried the same techniques here again:

![](../../../assets/b0c546d94bc04e33ff90e84f43851f8c.png)

Unfortunately it didn't work, and here we pay attention to the error at the end:

```bash
[-] Error:-ERR unknown command `system.exec`, with args beginning with: `whoami`, , check your module!
```

### HackTricks to the rescue

I looked this error up and found the following on HackTricks:

![](../../../assets/a0d2b582614a8bf95dc8e74fc99c3b7d.png)

I follow the instructions and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand.git
cd RedisModules-ExecuteCommand
sudo make
```

And as a result I get the following `module.so` file:

![](../../../assets/aa5926c0555ea331788397c56cb4cc13.png)

I can now go ahead and upload this to `ftp` and execute the `rce` script again.

### Redis-cli

Now that we have uploaded the module to `ftp` we need to `LOAD` it using `redis-cli`:

When that is done we can now execute the rce payload.

# Foothold
## Shell as Pablo

Just like that we got easy access.

# Privilege Escalation
## Enumeration

I launched `linpeas.sh` and started checking the results:

![](../../../assets/fcbcbeea582491b2706fe1c769ac0467.png)

That's quite an outdated Linux version

![](../../../assets/930927e00618dcf71acdd8200ac996db.png)

However it also displayed `PwnKit`:

![](../../../assets/2e282ecc666b5f6cc8dd138dc09bf3f1.png)

Since I already had the script locally I would upload and run it.
