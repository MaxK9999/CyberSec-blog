## Recon

### Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV zenphoto -sT -T5 --min-rate=5000 -Pn -vvvv 

PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION

I don't recall seeing port `23` before, I'll definitely have to check it out.


### 80/TCP - HTTP

I then did some directory fuzzing:

![](../../../assets/9bbb6e280182ab77dff9da5d9b58117f.png)

Let's check out some of the matches:

![](../../../assets/72dca51864fe3d76754be795b6facb1f.png)

![](../../../assets/266988d51444e850238f6160b1b73d35.png)

And we have a `robots.txt` file.

![](../../../assets/40e664a98e6c077898259849bd855164.png)

On the `/test` page we have a search bar, upon entering data we see the following in the URL:

:::note
This COULD point to some sort of **File Inclusion** vulnerability.

## PoC 
### RFI - FAIL

I decided to check for some PoC's online:

![](../../../assets/6c3a6413e2828c8c4e0b839abda5dade.png)

There appear to be multiple exploits, since we don't know the exact 

![](../../../assets/61514e9b6c9b8ff04bf9148773f041d4.png)

I checked out the PoC and found the following:

![](../../../assets/b1f7c11d875b64a14dfa515b09c4528d.png)

I still checked out the URL and found a login screen, however I could not find default creds. 

![](../../../assets/05175ee588af3a250c810906ed5ee8c0.png)

### Hydra

I tried out `hydra` in order to crack the user and password:

![](../../../assets/346d7811ab91d63099c1e3567bca11e0.png)

I let it run while I checked for other options.


### LFI - FAIL

![](../../../assets/1037bec3c13850c9bc7831d8fe02fec4.png)

![](../../../assets/54048ed256ad29c850a22502fb135afd.png)

![](../../../assets/c5321249ebafaf20b426de143c7f761c.png)

:::fail
This was also a bust.
:::

### RCE - CVE-2011-4825

:::tip
It was only here that I decided to check out the source code using `curl`, better late than never.
:::

![](../../../assets/ae67b1208de7a251dc99cc27404299dc.png)

Using `curl` I actually found out the version running.

I decided to use `searchsploit` to look up whether there were any other exploits:

![](../../../assets/983bbfbbe3c39e5891e3a39a04b44758.png)

:::important
Well here we go, good to know for the next time before we dive in too deep.
:::

I then went on to grab this PoC and checking it out using my code editor of choice.

![](../../../assets/838ba140655deeb7fcc1f3ee45591e67.png)

![](../../../assets/4382abfef424ee5eae40ba8ab302fda1.png)

Pretty straightforward stuff here, let's run it.

## Foothold
### www-data

![](../../../assets/bae8013e08873ea78ef8b4098f20d8ee.png)

super simple stuff, let's see what users are on here.

![](../../../assets/b8d3556731a8fb6ada6aa511a4b329d3.png)

No users? Weird, perhaps there's no `user.txt` either?

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/0b836d833ae4b6a7db42ed06d90981bb.png)

Well that's a first.

:::note
For whatever reason I was ONLY able to get a stable rev shell after rebooting the VM, downloading a new VPN pack and reconnecting:

## Privilege Escalation

I downloaded over `linpeas.sh` and started enum, first thing I noticed was the extremely old Linux version:

![](../../../assets/0c1ab6eeb0f6d7c8644ff80a3c860783.png)

Alarm bells started tingling, I looked it up:

![](../../../assets/1e4df33ec0788f3d0a8fa60ccc5de6a6.png)

There were a LOT of exploits here.

:::fail
However fucking none of them worked.
:::

## CVE-2010-3904

I then broadened the search and found some more exploits, specifically this one:

![](../../../assets/8b5543a9859a5aaf828de42649140856.png)

This one actually worked!

![](../../../assets/127a21ed7623c944909dd669a489b564.png)

:::danger
I had to `exit` my shell first because it was throwing off the script:
![](../../../assets/d1582cbbc2d5fa133168cc075eb54a66.png)
:::

### proof.txt

![](../../../assets/8a1c74f3482fcebe2d8843094567243f.png)

:::summary
In true OffSec fashion, rabbitholes, technical issues and a CVE only exploitation.
Didn't really learn much, this *intermediate* is sure easier than the [[Hack The Box]] *easy* ones.
