It appears this box only has 2 open ports. Let's start with enumerating port 80.

:::note
In the meantime I will run gobuster in order to enumerate sub directories.
:::

### Gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://bullybox.local -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,pdf,config
```

This gave a huge output of a bunch of numbers endpoints, but I did find one that could help my further search:

I reran gobuster again using a different list:

![](../../../assets/b6539bfceccf33f2624e2231f7de938b.png)

Found something!

We'll first enumerate the website, then perhaps come back to this.


### 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/b38abefed1274281917893eb61c44081.png)

Here I registered for an account and logged in:

![](../../../assets/dc6e1630db5419be6d9f864d2709d66b.png)

From the page source we find the HIGHLY LIKELY version of **BoxBilling** running:

![](../../../assets/8acbe09f2b5974fd1b8b28a07229d7c5.png)

Looking up this version online yields the following:

![](../../../assets/b46b7605a8c1be84aa28de1f9704c898.png)

![](../../../assets/ebbc93fb220ea24a2713ac447f41f295.png)

Unfortunately we do not have *admin* access yet. I checked how to acquire it:

![](../../../assets/ec693a2524fd030235922a485430bc7b.png)

![](../../../assets/7dc024ed67fd7af11ad26f43418114ba.png)

We've now found the admin log in area.

Whenever I enter some sort of creds I get this popup:

![](../../../assets/9272897a252a19602ed0257555e903c1.png)

I went and inspected the POST request using burp.


### git-dumper

We still really need the admin creds to modify the request.

Let's check out that `.git` directory again using a tool called `git-dumper`.

```bash
pipx install git-dumper
```

![](../../../assets/b72526b0b8410d5d9cf986ab89eb4307.png)

This resulted in an absolute massive output.

![](../../../assets/402b2f5ca3744170ab1ac7e120b2446f.png)

Here I found the config file at the top which was LIKELY to contain a password in this case:

![](../../../assets/48ed9393951b0fde9a35d08e592ca358.png)

Awesome, we got the admin creds. Let's move forwards

```creds
admin
Playing-Unstylish7-Provided
```

Now we still need the email in order to log in.

![](../../../assets/2d1962fb717df4f2de724dfe913a5ce0.png)

We have succesfully logged in as admin.

### RCE

To make our life easier there's a ready-made GitHub PoC available for us:

![](../../../assets/b43ab85ae66438fb7d3506b0d249e9c2.png)

:::caution
The script failed on me at the start because of some dependency issues but was solved by using `sudo apt install python3-pwntools`.
:::

We then make sure the last modifications are done:

![](../../../assets/4b7aaebcd453b9a2df28a2cf5ba3b0dd.png)

Nice we got our shell, time to get the flag:

![](../../../assets/58b8ed67e84d5ccdd3c5bbbddfb52331.png)

Well shit. Let's do some enumeration.

![](../../../assets/26f23b1ee3a77e59653f7e2fd3ad1ddf.png)

Oh well that saves some time.

Ez pz.
