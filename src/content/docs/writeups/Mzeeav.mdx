### 80/TCP - HTTP

However when we intercept the server response we notice the following error:

![](../../../assets/5c4b4d64ab940bd7a42f3ce52acf7057.png)

The client however does not show this error.

Using `feroxbuster` I found some more directories:

![](../../../assets/802f6f58713f94d18fbabc1042afcddb.png)

When I go ahead and upload one of the `upload` files:

![](../../../assets/33ff0ab5cd619ca812b54b1ad7333182.png)

No error.

Let's check out the  `upload.php` script to figure out what's happening when we try to upload a file:

![](../../../assets/58054700f32f18a7cb9f2ca6da01f468.png)

I head on over to this endpoint:

### Exploit

So in order to exploit this we need to understand what `upload.php` does.

It basically checks whether the file contains `45DA` as the first bytes:

![](../../../assets/3f8c6148d2309504689d3f1f2f7892d9.png)

We can exploit this by prepending these bytes to our malicious webshell.

![](../../../assets/21344fdd8fb0e231acc3568217f2a443.png)

![](../../../assets/dbfbf4071b10007272f6df6d48dc8853.png)

We now see that it has been successfully uploaded.

![](../../../assets/e63924f783a5a66e72482ddad5bf6e19.png)

We notice the page does *not* return an error, however neither does it return any output.

:::fail
This means that we probably have to intercept it with `burp` and add the `MZ` in front after the upload.

### Burpsuite

We see no error this time, let's see if it worked.

We get a shell as *www-data*.

### Enumeration

As always I start my enumeration from top down `/`.

:::note
I couldn't read the file since it was owned by *root*, but this might come in handy for when we're *avuser*?
:::

I downloaded `linpeas.sh`

Let's try and see what this binary does.


## Privilege Escalation

![](../../../assets/b3a8e879289c55e425e96e611906c880.png)

It acts sort of like `ls`?

![](../../../assets/ae48b83db3af4ccfb6d1032db5753423.png)

I tried some commands but they didn't work, let's check out the `-version` instead:

![](../../../assets/15aa7234e30bf50da6e04be7bacbb7db.png)

Oh so it's actually the `find` binary disguised as another binary.

Using GTFOBins we find the binary and what we need for privesc:

:::note
For whatever reason I wasn't able to use `cat proof.txt` so I went ahead and transferred my `id_rsa.pub` as `authorized_keys` and got SSH access.

:::bug
I had to revert the box to be able to properly read `proof.txt`.

## proof.txt

Pretty fun and simple box.
