For some reason there's just 3 SSH services running which seems odd.

There's also a `telnet` server running and a web server on `8091`. When heading to the webpage we're just greeted with the following:

We notice the `Basic realm=RaspAP` name so let's check for default creds.

I tried it and was succesfull.

For now I went ahead and enumerated the other ports as well:


### SMTP

I tried to use `hydra` to brute force myself into it using a password list but got a bunch of error messages:

For now nothing came of the other ports.

## Initial Foothold

### 8091/TCP - HTTP

I went ahead and took a dive into this web page and started snooping around.

![](../../../assets/6dce9b792428987ed8a6c8c59ac9543b.png)

I checked around and found [the following](https://github.com/gerbsec/CVE-2020-24572-POC):

![](../../../assets/ca6867e36693a689454ef8e5d94e6b23.png)

I downloaded and inspected it:

![](../../../assets/dd9d05139e3d37b5adf457d8f61ca420.png)

:::success
Luckily for me the payload fired right away and I got access as `www-data`.

Here I found the same users that `smtp-user-check` enumerated for me.

### local.txt

I went into `walter`'s directory since I had access and got the flag:

## Privilege Escalation

For my next steps I started off with `sudo -l`:

![](../../../assets/6261a0937e2cbf53c0b9489e93de0f3b.png)

I notice that I can run the `wifi_reset.py` binary using sudo as `www-data` which could be a potential priv-esc manouvre.

![](../../../assets/b8e6863d80dd2ec7802026d6f05d164b.png)

There must be a way for us to create our own version of `wifi_reset.py` that gives us a root shell.

We cannot *edit* the current file since it is owned by `root` however.

![](../../../assets/0f1983869dde4f436af57ea6fea28a53.png)

Still I was able to `rm` the current file and replace it with my own:

![](../../../assets/39fe635469881327a3e1d2d97647da5a.png)

I could now go ahead and run the binary as `sudo`.
