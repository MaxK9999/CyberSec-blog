We've got a web server running, as well as multiple `pop3` servers, and 2 `SMB` servers.

We'll start off enumerating the web page first, for this I'll check for hidden directories first.


## Gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.188.39 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php,config,zip,pdf
```

From this enumeration I found this endpoint which I could then access and view the directories through:

# Initial Foothold

## 80/TCP - HTTP

Using `curl` I checked the headers of the webpage:

![](../../../assets/03033e043177b75a351e8e40f7a5ee66.png)

Nothing of grave interest except for the Ubuntu version and that it's running `PHP` in the tech stack.

From our previous enumeration using gobuster we found some directories that might be of interest. I then jumped into this rabbit hole and starting looking for possible entry points:

![](../../../assets/245f128ec34b6b07d8538b7dd9a4ea6f.png)

Here I clicked on `test.html` and got the following:

![](../../../assets/b3318e7a2712381d12ea7c54f5363c24.png)

Could this mean we could upload arbitrary files via this page?

When we try to upload the `php-reverse-shell.php` file we get the following error:

![](../../../assets/02141369613d48e17c0c114f06b6577a.png)

>[!info]
>Following [this blog](https://secureyes.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/File-Upload-Vulnerability-in-FCKEditor.pdf) there is a version of **FCKEditor** in which we could modify the request using burpsuite and change the behaviour of the file afterwards. Below I tried this out.

![](../../../assets/e396d6cfb52298bfe2f2678d75eac2e9.png)

After adding this line we should be able to change the behaviour.

![](../../../assets/6480daf26361709735ba2227fe5bc311.png)

It didn't work, meaning the version is HIGHLY LIKELY newer.

Let's try a different approach.


## Keep It Simple Stupid

I went back to the main page of the site where I found a login screen in the top right. Here I could once again just log in using default creds `admin - admin`.

>[!note]
>OffSec *loves* default credentials like admin - admin.

Afterwards I wanted to know how to check the version of **CS-Cart** the server was running in order to check for exploits:

![](../../../assets/c8efe11af5fef23efdc9d7350f1ecdab.png)

Well that's pretty easy.

![](../../../assets/f4a709499e125068a811a19b7c8826a6.png)

Let's check for vulnerabilities.

![](../../../assets/235d0b2875811a218c596080c158f448.png)

Yeah this explanation sucks. After some more checking I found [the following blog](https://gist.github.com/momenbasel/ccb91523f86714edb96c871d4cf1d05c):

![](../../../assets/78b2560f2c606d109616e084121cdf67.png)

Let's check it out.

![](../../../assets/15bc51c23ca1c664eeec60433d8b626a.png)

>[!note]
>Same creds, `admin - admin`.

![](../../../assets/70baacbd18b2d1e1018349a297d889c0.png)

And we got a succesful shell.

# Privilege Escalation

Now it was time to escalate our privileges.

Let's enumerate the environment.

## Enumeration

>[!note]
>Below I've dumped every finding that I could link something to.

![](../../../assets/b5c43ab4e458ac79773cbf7917376ea7.png)
![](../../../assets/1bdb62af38a3c0313e2978dc445b72a4.png)

![](../../../assets/4b5eeace5ee42f112763860e817921b8.png)

![](../../../assets/9cec391e98376f575ea73ff381019d5d.png)

But the one that really stood out was all the way at the bottom:

![](../../../assets/d42b4f9e08540a567d71c254ea01a75c.png)

Let's check the file out:

![](../../../assets/3642ef84ab03bf7ee03ad0e8bf008d97.png)

Well well, I guess we can log into the db using `root - root`.

>[!fail]
>Alas I was *NOT* able to log in for some reason.

![](../../../assets/2cd0e61df278477db14ad081e115a565.png)

From here I could guess that since whomever created this machine was using the same creds for user and password, e.g.

```
admin - admin
root - root
```

Perhaps other users were also configured in the same way? 

Let's try out to log in as *patrick*.

>[!important]
>I ran into issues with the shell as well as logging in via SSH, the only way it would work is written below:

```bash
# Spawn python shell
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

# Export TERM
export TERM=xterm

# SSH into localhost via reverse shell
ssh patrick@localhost

# Use creds patrick - patrick
```

![](../../../assets/c67f09cf7bec32388489b2c90ed88f64.png)

From here we could enumerate the system again:

![](../../../assets/43e71eb31892d0994346c12d7bb9e1d6.png)

Since we can run any command let's grab the `proof.txt` flag.
