It appears we have a webserver called `Retro Gaming` running on **WordPress 5.5.1** (which we will confirm).

We have a **MySQL** database on `3306` to which we are *NOT* allowed to connect.

Port `5000` is running a Python web server (presumably the backend server).

Port `13000` is running **nginx 1.18.0**.

Lastly port `36445` is running a **SMB 4.6.2** server.


## 80/TCP - HTTP

To further enumerate I first of all went to the website and checked it out.

I inspected it closer using *WappAlyzer*:

![](../../../assets/27bf4bfc39bd7da6d6ed6f197e88708d.png)

## wpscan

In order to see what plugins might be vulnerable I used `wpscan` to check the website:

```bash
wpscan --url http://nukem
```

I then checked out the file and saw the following that stood out:

![](../../../assets/3a83982cb7e91e302bea79d8e2f5ee14.png)

![](../../../assets/24cfa3031dc06b7acf6a9cb794a49b7c.png)

Knowing this I decided to check whether there's a ready-made PoC available for this version.

![](../../../assets/b805d4ff720204c78388551529221dfe.png)

Found it.

Furthermore I also found the **Simple-file-list** exploit:

![](../../../assets/20c7859ca03ed8c79ee8624aaae866b0.png)

Now this looked a bit more promising, let's try this one out.


# Initial Foothold

The PoC looked somewhat as follows:

![](../../../assets/1fb60f5240146f286d9409ef91fb3e4b.png)

This file had to be edited in order for it to work.

I modified **line 36** to the following which would give me a webshell:

```python
payload = '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>'
```

![](../../../assets/cf8b1faf3e97415f6578c7ad4598aeb9.png)

Then I went to the website:

![](../../../assets/fdf04dc4b1a5352a9efbe22f73aa148e.png)

From here I could go ahead and craft up a reverse shell that would connect back to me, but first I got the `local.txt` flag.


### local.txt

### Reverse Shell - Fail

From here on I had to url encode a simple reverse shell in order to get a normal shell.

>[!fail]
>Unfortunately enough I tried a bunch of different variations and got stuck, so I had to improvise.

![](../../../assets/1b758d17078df070d4f1bbb15c586820.png)


### Reverse Shell -Success

For this attempt I went ahead and put a php reverse shell in place of the previous webshell command:

![](../../../assets/109d8cdb69eb00f127a5316c3879ac3c.png)

![](../../../assets/1230d733fa5e1237f2dcc97c6e8533eb.png)

Now that I finally had a shell I could get to exploiting.

>[!summary]
>1) I quickly found out that I had a shell as `http` and I could *NOT* run `sudo -l`.
>2) I was able to view `commander`'s `/home` directory.


## System Enumeration

Before I could go ahead and escalate my privileges, I had to first understand what environment I am dealing with.

To do this I went ahead and issued the following commands:

![](../../../assets/fb62d1a04db788937bfd47456196f8fb.png)

It seems we're dealing with an **Arch Linux** environment, which is a bit different from Debian-based Linux systems.

Since I couldn't find anything useful right away I decided to look for any config files:

```bash
find / -type f -name "*config*" 2>/dev/null
```

Amongst these I found this one file:

```bash
/srv/http/wp-config.php
```

![](../../../assets/4280ffc3d844fce48b5ce651938cf84f.png)

This could be a really important file for us!!!

![](../../../assets/4b0f719fa5f315713f54bb0851431d9b.png)

Look at that, appears we got the creds for *commander*:

```
commander
CommanderKeenVorticons1990
```

As for the rest of the file I couldn't find anything useful.

![](../../../assets/1ecb98f7884d865a93c3c8e74248e8b6.png)

Like that we're now the *commander* user.


## MySQL

![](../../../assets/cad05e0b6ecbddefef8e8e591e3a332d.png)

And now we can enumerate databases.

![](../../../assets/03254de10d8e3060040337b8384a21a4.png)

![](../../../assets/976931ca4c322739435e128c36b070ba.png)

![](../../../assets/6cd15e401e42d6f21f02d8ca10599786.png)

It seems to be only the admin user, for now we'll just note this and look for other vectors to get `root`.


# Privilege Escalation

I am not allowed to run `sudo -l` so there must be another way.

Apparently the attack vector was way easier, I looked at the binaries again:

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![](../../../assets/7eb31e6b09268f55b2fa41e1fc57f3c4.png)

I started checking all of them on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dosbox/) when I found `dosbox` to be interesting:

![](../../../assets/76b5697516e1b4d0a39fdd4320541694.png)

I will be writing the following to the `/etc/sudoers` file so *commander* can also become part of the sudoers group.

```bash
LFILE='/etc/sudoers'
/usr/bin/dosbox -c  'mount c /' -c "echo commander ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL >> c:$LFILE" -c exit
```

![](../../../assets/fe324a9e54ae9a9fab13f39a8ad7fe3d.png)

Now if everything went correctly, I can go ahead and issue `sudo -l` now.

![](../../../assets/19478a0b5264d71e680bb83a00dc7eee.png)

Awesome.

Now all that's left to do is:
