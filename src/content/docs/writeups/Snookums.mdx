Since we had 2 SMB ports open I reran with `--script smb-vuln*` for good measure:

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE     REASON  VERSION
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: SAMBA)

```

Starting off we notice that we are allowed to log into `ftp - 21` as `anonymous`.

Unfortunately enough the service kept hanging and gave no valuable output.

Then we have a webpage called **Simple Photo Gallery** running on **Apache, CentOS**.

Furthermore we have 2 **MySQL** ports and a bunch of higher number ports that seem to be *closed*.

We also have `port 111 - rpcbind` which I haven't heard of before:

![](../../../assets/8b4842f0f8182f8613168ef0bd7e3839.png)

For this port I've found [this blog](https://hackviser.com/tactics/pentesting/services/rpcbind) on how to pentest it. For now I've confirmed that it is open:

# Initial Foothold 

## 80/TCP - HTTP

Learning from past boxes I understood that I had to **KISS** and go with the most logical simple vector first.

![](../../../assets/9902d07d5744550816ab72376a7f5266.png)

I looked up this version online and lo and behold:

![](../../../assets/cfc7b2571928b55b5befbe463a23b329.png)

>[!note]
>I also found a PoC for `0.8` on exploit-db but that one did not work.

![](../../../assets/ff90b688040f57bb78b73ba71e98c74c.png)

Let's test it out.

![](../../../assets/96b302448a053732457788ee36187190.png)

Perfect, directory traversal works. Now let's upload a shell.

![](../../../assets/476f2090230275168781e8838c64ce4f.png)

But the reverse shell did not fire.

>[!important]
>I changed the mtu settings to `mtu 1250` and the port to `445` and the shell fired this time.

## Enumeration

Good, we're in.

I quickly found out that we do not have sufficient permissions to enter the `/home/michael` directory.

![](../../../assets/edd4e643adbd6d8edc5f83e2ba2acb85.png)

I could not run `sudo -l` either because of the lack of a password.


>[!note]
>I upgraded my shell using the following commands:

```bash
# Spawn python shell
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

# Export TERM
export TERM=xterm
```

I checked `crontab` but couldn't find anything.
There was also nothing inside the binary files that stood out.

I then started enumerating the web root:

![](../../../assets/8f9f7474f77abc431aecfc5d5fa2ef6f.png)

`db.php` sounds interesting!

```php
<?php
define('DBHOST', '127.0.0.1');
define('DBUSER', 'root');
define('DBPASS', 'MalapropDoffUtilize1337');
define('DBNAME', 'SimplePHPGal');
?>
```

Awesome, finally some creds.

![](../../../assets/d33eb37e51a8a95af75deca0b04bd974.png)

Awesome, we got db access.

>[!note]
>We keep in mind that there are 2 ports available, where the non-default is on 33060 which we could check out if this one doesn't have what we need.

![](../../../assets/b9d7a2872882f2c6f9a06975f1b14e78.png)

Awesome, we got 3 users and their encrypted hashes. Let's decrypt them

```

```

![](../../../assets/36d1048efe424709b01413cb98ad5026.png)

Well that's unfortunate, let's use john or hashcat then.

![](../../../assets/13ea6e712d5dfbecf28a356c34d2706e.png)

Got it, they're *double* base64 encrypted.

```creds
michael HockSydneyCertify123
josh MobilizeHissSeedtime747
serena OverallCrestLean000
```

>[!note]
>Quick FYI, port `33060` had the exact same database info, nothing different.

![](../../../assets/73b98188220025a3d61b9fb08e93bf46.png)

We have successfully logged in as *Michael*.

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/6656d032eda4b91dad094375250ce3f8.png)

Unfortunately we weren't able to check `sudo -l` nor log in as `root` with the other creds found:

![](../../../assets/f80ed494ad039197743443a5e97df4ad.png)


# Privilege Escalation

Since we had Michael's password there was no longer a need for the reverse shell, instead I went and logged in via SSH in order to get a stable shell.

From here I transferred `linpeas.sh` to speed up the enumeration process.

I fired it up and started looking for interesting bits.


## More Enumeration

![](../../../assets/43857f10fb15caf75200cfa23c5b6dbd.png)

![](../../../assets/3395b42f9796af62cb76da3396398241.png)

But above all others:

![](../../../assets/9967ef5abe34dc29bef13be4e3ab1341.png)
![](../../../assets/30b71462460d95ef05e033c07858f5ca.png)

This means we can go ahead and a new user `root2` with the same privileges as `root`.

To put this in practice it will look somewhat like this:

```bash
# Add new user root2 - w00t
echo "root2:nYEMRr1PQFYBg:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd

# Change to new user
su root2
```

![](../../../assets/1108647d0a4770a82553d6ab8c9df581.png)

It worked!!!
