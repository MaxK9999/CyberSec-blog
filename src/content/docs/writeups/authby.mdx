## 21/TCP - FTP

There's a boatload of files here, but I can't transfer them since they're owned by root:

![](../../../assets/7a9fcb419814102542207f8a94a88639.png)

Luckily for us it seems that all we have to do is *omit* the `-a` option and try logging in with default creds.

I first tried the other port to no avail

![](../../../assets/cd005275f79c02c3e6999290db2c431b.png)

And then I tried 21 again

![](../../../assets/9756ad71325cc41320e8d47b7449b2e4.png)

We get in using default `admin - admin` creds!

The directory looks a whole lot different now as well.

![](../../../assets/c9843fc77194e5924c086769b1b9d42e.png)

Let's check them out.

## Hashcat

Let's go ahead and crack it.

![](../../../assets/0cd735747dc1430d7bc47e3fd820bb2d.png)

![](../../../assets/c82b6f6f557d0dfbb26b5c2d5f8eb546.png)

## 242/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/721bd90fdabf7b4c7f3c3768bc9564b2.png)

![](../../../assets/f0543807b0653033284e3f96af98e3e0.png)

![](../../../assets/2d35259150cc4dee0b1160d96b8f7c1e.png)

I then checked whether the creds could be the ones for RDP but it seems they're invalid:

![](../../../assets/e58aaf8cf5c33919d011626d8a5abd26.png)

However we can try **Remote File Upload** via FTP! 

![](../../../assets/5d18637be61391f216e79d58ab3dd375.png)

![](../../../assets/dcd5c7c344faff5356a3664544af5563.png)

Since we have access as *admin* on FTP we can easily upload any sort of file. Let's see if this reflects on the website.

![](../../../assets/a83b45a2880c09ce344113c750fdab55.png)

Awesome, this proves that the FTP server is indeed the docroot, let's go ahead and make a webshell payload that we will `put` onto the FTP server.

![](../../../assets/ceb7f3c200c4d8b9f769089dcab3d473.png)

![](../../../assets/a973038dc6b0c92ab28782bac98fd021.png)

![](../../../assets/0f90c35a7f1942856ab861ad32ef1512.png)

Let's check out what else we can do:

![](../../../assets/cb9ad14dd3d9bcd39aa856f0d253f2df.png)

Hell yeah, let's upload one of the potatoes to the docroot, and execute it to get ourselves a *SYSTEM* shell right away.

![](../../../assets/b69163d1cc0536df6f0daa6caa54967a.png)

![](../../../assets/4f7f0f2062b656cba2aa802ade24f2de.png)

![](../../../assets/a8ced10148eb420eeb055a4fbb698175.png)

Unfortunately this did not seem to work.

I decided to ping my own IP to see whether there was an issue of some sorts

![](../../../assets/3a8fb3c11d45c63e0479623a52b649d5.png)

![](../../../assets/65e45487d7ed38edb8a11b6db719b237.png)

This seemed to work however.


# Foothold

I then proceeded to simply initiate a reverse shell via the `nc.exe` binary I'd uploaded.

![](../../../assets/dccd68c60a0d35a08cd4213502011ec4.png)

![](../../../assets/fa34e2e399f245d2b547a4867d95f76f.png)

>[!caution]
>Well this explains why the `powershell` reverse shell wouldn't kick in.

# Privilege Escalation

## Abusing privileges

![](../../../assets/a9e673689601da4497e098d6b19a57ae.png)

I guess this won't fire since we have the 64-bit version.

![](../../../assets/862456c66599e212952a2c60e329ea02.png)

Well this wouldn't work either, what now?

Looks like none of the other potatoes worked either, let's do some more enumeration.


## Enum

![](../../../assets/15ab6dfe42a8fd0d36a95d7a42ef112b.png)

It appears to be a clean install of **Windows Server 2008**, there *MUST* be some exploits for it.

![](../../../assets/0f057a884dbdd9f2df9657918ad6efe1.png)

Perfect, let's check out the PoC

![](../../../assets/069786c39a98759b235a990ceb0718b2.png)

Alrighty then, pretty straightforward. Let's compile it.

![](../../../assets/2c88826071ff4cdc3d0ffc113ba10d58.png)

We transfer it over and *instantly* become **SYSTEM**

![](../../../assets/7e8f9812c34603ef51a16f8b8f7efc59.png)
