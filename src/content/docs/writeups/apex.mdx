### 445/TCP - SMB
### Enum4linux-ng

![](../../../assets/22fc396c637ddedc5708c93e928e415c.png)

Time to check out the `docs` directory.

### Smbclient

![](../../../assets/4d158dcd17bd0108e782fd95acf65470.png)

I checked out the `.pdf` files and they contained a few pages of medical records and such.

![](../../../assets/a1358f670c18265d55a421cc31d5755d.png)

### Exiftool

Just in case I used `exiftool` to view the metadata of the files.

### 80/TCP - HTTP

I opened up my browser and expected to see some sort of hospital website:

![](../../../assets/69b9003464e386ad871584eac0e6f775.png)

Indeed it is.

Here I find a few possible usernames:

![](../../../assets/dd439b5bb73b0aebb6f21dc8503445e5.png)

The contact form didn't seem vulnerable:

![](../../../assets/1d364792e43fda06d2221a8ffa5ad16e.png)

I clicked on **Scheduler** and this took me to a login page:

![](../../../assets/afcd74f0226bf16e4f9cf6ecb6c7eaf3.png)

I tried out `admin - admin` but this didn't work:

![](../../../assets/e906167f71da908b0045ba0778f946fa.png)

### Gobuster

I launched `gobuster` to enumerate the directories and endpoints:

![](../../../assets/87808248ec2eae8562dc25288a9e8c2b.png)

I found a `admin.php` page which I checked out:

![](../../../assets/76f93ed5850c514add3bbd2a08223858.png)

Awesome we found the version, let's look for an exploit!

![](../../../assets/7ef6eae4282aaba166894901cb264815.png)

We need to be authenticated though, we have potential usernames but not the passwords.

I started searching further and found the following directory:

![](../../../assets/0e57d50189d52e98d376ebebd1abe727.png)

![](../../../assets/b08876ead8b902187f6707dc02f47447.png)

In here I could apparently upload files!

### LFI - Responsive Filemanager 9.13.4

I tried uploading a webshell but it wasn't allowed:

![](../../../assets/191c270fac5568460553116c8cbc319d.png)

We could now brute force filetypes and check whether any would be allowed but I decided to enumerate further first.

I noticed a little question mark in the top right corner:

![](../../../assets/9af1a352bb678ad7b6d5f4778b2eef3d.png)

![](../../../assets/5de7701de9b1658e2419e421fa22a29f.png)

Ah yes... We now got another version.

![](../../../assets/4ebc966f71db831c62206f7af9610355.png)

![](../../../assets/8f83e9ce38ff1b89f3c647cda25b3d36.png)

![](../../../assets/9c2a6c9bc0de79cb1c8a3d48877398c7.png)

Pretty straightforward 

![](../../../assets/9acad1df37b8b12db11234b62c0cb3dc.png)

![](../../../assets/99e39302b1c13b598121aab5ddfea531.png)

Unfortunate

We need to find another way to get RCE.

## Foothold
### Checking Source Code 

I checked out GitHub where I found the source code to `openemr` where they had the following `sqlconf.php` file:

![](../../../assets/5b019e2762c57af207e7462ae01ae420.png)

I checked whether this existed here, perhaps it could contain credentials:

![](../../../assets/3560b23b8e66f7522a8605b9765e3bc4.png)

No error, meaning it HIGHLY LIKELY exists, let's try reading it using the LFI exploit.

:::note
Before doing this however we need to make slight changes to the PoC, we'll have to change the `read_file` `url_path` so we can get the file via `smb`, namely because the file won't be read on the client side as it is a `.php` file:

![](../../../assets/427a231cb3186921679c754c5884e070.png)

Now we can grab it and check the contents.

## 3306/TCP - MySQL

>[!danger]
>I had to issue the `skip_ssl` option otherwise it *WOULD NOT WORK*!!!!
>![](../../../assets/3af0dcb5bcd57c1f2885763575c4b2fb.png)

![](../../../assets/b1314ac3613d4cb51b7d3e777cf8625c.png)

We gain access with the found password.

![](../../../assets/d831258a8e7b0d3988e5a11e5bd1cc02.png)

![](../../../assets/f067e42ebf832b8835a00287cf174875.png)

This was obviously not the pass?

I checked the tables again:

![](../../../assets/71bc7fb23e202117c42ecee4f8e6a8a2.png)

![](../../../assets/5116df9911b66c3bec735caeb424a6a8.png)

```

$2a$05$bJcIfCBjN5Fuh0K9qfoe0n$
```

## Hashcat

I threw the hash into `hashcat`:

![](../../../assets/a26b1b6e787f22c099588bccd20289ab.png)

![](../../../assets/518cfdcb9616d3dcb961613f37a16c3c.png)

I could now use these creds to log in to the portal.

```
admin
thedoctor
```

## RCE - OpenEMR 5.0.1

I then followed the previously found github RCE steps:

![](../../../assets/81c2608bf22b3c1b5c0a10b892cdb5ba.png)

![](../../../assets/8fb247217bd2960019f8ae661d857622.png)

![](../../../assets/255a6b484d9f7535191b668589b370fb.png)

Yeah this didn't work, let's check alternative scripts.

![](../../../assets/788ce098e3c26d5d644e93504930a0bf.png)

I went ahead and launched the following one:

![](../../../assets/44ae8840b52d00f744206d4f1408f2d2.png)

![](../../../assets/b66c9c48540488f570136313ee7f25bc.png)

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/03cd70f52e6fff8a8c72b3f01685a900.png)

## Privilege Escalation
### Shell as root

Since the password was for the *admin* user, we can try and password spray before doing any further enum:

![](../../../assets/9d303ad1343071e45377b9a69cc089f6.png)

Easiest privesc ever.

### proof.txt

![](../../../assets/39f224acee6da69742ee753766388507.png)

>[!summary]
>This one was indeed *VERY HARD*
>I needed help on multiple occassions
>- More source code checking
>- Chained CVE's
>- Password Spraying
