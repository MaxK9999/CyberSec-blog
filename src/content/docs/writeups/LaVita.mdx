### 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/063d3a1e932f52a0c9e377da34bf35a3.png)

This page featured a lot of name, possibly some of them could be usernames.

![](../../../assets/6565ba5586530e44780f7666ff70a5bd.png)

I went ahead and ran a `feroxbuster` scan.

![](../../../assets/99a37b51983c2869170cc8c315703144.png)

I was able to find the version of **Laravel** running on one of the endpoints:

![](../../../assets/32c81f59d6933afa8d98d07283208def.png)

There are some existing RCE PoC's for versions up to `8.4.2`:

![](../../../assets/001923257ed63456e578515c0d0f6f29.png)

However by itself the exploit didn't work:

![](../../../assets/8a116de097d8c10f5f29216c2f373663.png)

There is an `/image_upload` endpoint, meaning we might be able to upload our malicious file there, however it is beyond a login.

![](../../../assets/ff0ee5e5a6a827256f1630920220f894.png)

## Image Upload - FAIL

I went ahead and created an account and logged in

![](../../../assets/f14be70897b27ff3fa29e7e3546d054b.png)

I tried out uploading a random picture:

![](../../../assets/861213f902061d7aa1ae5ef3aae4120b.png)

![](../../../assets/5c605a9091ff950479b9b1717208eee0.png)

`.png` files got accepted, I thus tried to upload a `webshell.png` file, which I would intercept with `burp`, and afterwards change to `webshell.php` again.

![](../../../assets/42f31e70c9fd959433945ab7169c2783.png)

However this wouldn't work either.

## RCE exploit

Perhaps the exploit was right all along, let's look at it closer:

![](../../../assets/c4024d797a9d6f7d80b177d48a3e0220.png)

Let's see if we can access this endpoint.

![](../../../assets/33b42abfa4bc4df977cc3172e06615bf.png)

Holy shit we can! 

However this is only the 1st part since for the PoC we still need to find the `path_log`:

![](../../../assets/057a9484e21d1943406df1640cfb610f.png)

So let's see if we can find anything else:

![](../../../assets/35c2e76cc3d6ed2c94a6aee13e64abf0.png)

I found an even better version of this exploit [here](https://github.com/joshuavanderpoll/CVE-2021-3129?source=post_page-----12bfd272e9cf---------------------------------------):

![](../../../assets/8454f8b158d09cd4808403c97f7f902e.png)

![](../../../assets/2dc5e7f5327fe05d2e461cf23e94ded4.png)

![](../../../assets/2c6527ba3fee73be6e18c8b5c92529dd.png)

Awesome!

:::note
For some reason the exploit would only give an output on the second `chain`.

I now went on with trusty `busybox` to get me a reverse shell:

![](../../../assets/1586a1fa860dbe5ce3ea707e1007e8f3.png)


![](../../../assets/de736325b7a29884263f1c7ee790dd44.png)

![](../../../assets/99f0c6b53cd4103b8a8e54b32f04bce5.png)

## Foothold
### Shell as www-data

Now that we had a shell as *www-data* I went on to get the first flag

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/034b710a03c4f47bd6327e888a4e798c.png)

## Enumeration

![](../../../assets/a74d099bf662929e9ea44218578b85ef.png)

No quick wins.

![](../../../assets/72cc42ce95020c3f6a8829a07f5dbb4c.png)

I ran `linpeas.sh` and found some interesting stuff:

![](../../../assets/a3ee29c27283c987d88ce3a5f4214539.png)

```
lavita
sdfquelw0kly9jgbx92
```

And we find `mysql` running:

![](../../../assets/783ac1d89f62168f2a95b194cf318e57.png)

Let's try it out.


## Privilege Escalation
### MySQL

![](../../../assets/41cbb2eff9625fdbe53547e7eb6f1267.png)

![](../../../assets/7c5fc17c1bbffd313897d041a4eb4a47.png)

This is just our account, so this is not useful.

### pspy32

I transferred over `pspy32` to see the running processes, since this command runs indefinitely I ran it as follows:

```bash
timeout 60s ./pspy32
```

![](../../../assets/fc6b5a3fd526ea66f4b0433d10818a3d.png)

We find the following running under the *skunk* user.

![](../../../assets/25ff8f46371f146376b1057c11981afc.png)

### Replacing artisan

We will now attempt to replace the original `artisan` file with the `php-reverse-shell.php` file:

![](../../../assets/4fb9f0d2c86990f981d7f653f9e14b0e.png)

:::important
Since it will be executed as a binary, it needs the `#!/usr/bin/env php` just like the original file.
:::

![](../../../assets/58f0ab86ab43457f5118b26943e2db68.png)

Don't forget to use `chmod +x` on the file!!!

![](../../../assets/c504026db45871f18054abb23e098e3c.png)

Awesome! Now we have access as *skunk*, and it appears that he is part of the **sudo** group!!!

![](../../../assets/a3ae727ff64e2f50ca060bf8a3980d0c.png)

I look up the `composer` binary:

![](../../../assets/10cf42719faa37a75df4900d17441989.png)

We can get *root* by changing the `composer.json` file.

## Shell as root

First we need to do the following in the *www-data* shell:

```bash
mv composer.json composer.json.bak
echo '{"scripts":{"x":"chmod +s /bin/bash"}}' > composer.json
```

![](../../../assets/79dcf838918a387977f98188706d1db4.png)

Then we do the following as *skunk*:

```bash
sudo -u root /usr/bin/composer --working-dir\=/var/www/html/lavita run-script x
/bin/bash -p
```

![](../../../assets/f507b58014b1af9ed14597c1c1c0265a.png)

And we succesfully get *root*.
