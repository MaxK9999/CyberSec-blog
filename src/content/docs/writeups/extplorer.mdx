### 80/TCP - HTTP

I head on over and get routed to the following URL right away.

Not too sure whether this is supposed to be exposed...or whether we can exploit it ðŸ¤”

I looked it up and found a juicy [Bug Bounty WriteUp](https://medium.com/@srilakivarma/%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-how-i-hacked-a-wordpress-setup-and-gain-admin-privilege-and-got-paid-for-it-98a49433519f) about this exact topic, let's see if we can follow along:

This walkthrough was a bust as I was not able to create a `sql` account on the linked website, neither did simple testing pass this page:

So instead I launched `feroxbuster` and started enumerating.

I tried out this endpoint instead:

Cool we get a login page!

![](../../../assets/a7d40d365e7826dc079983d0da9ac4ac.png)

Nice, simple `admin - admin`, let's try it out.

![](../../../assets/cdc880f89c66fff9b1b736addee92d70.png)

We get in and I notice 2 users:

![](../../../assets/10d2e89c45fe4c14215e2ecf203f0119.png)

I went ahead and changed *dora* to **Admin** status as well, who knows if anything good will come from it.

Let's try to find some sort of exploit:

![](../../../assets/4ae4704c386500dcb1a0459e95e7fcf8.png)

I was able to upload a webshell

### Shell as www-data

From here I just had to send myself a reverse shell:

![](../../../assets/8f61df6353442efb92557b3d51a9935f.png)

I used the `upload` feature on penelope to upload `linpeas.sh` and other stuff to enhance my exploitation:

![](../../../assets/b9baea2df60b0b4b3847a923c5038368.png)

I found that *dora* is part of the **disk** group.

![](../../../assets/a7cafe47353115bd4444d05c5c098d52.png)

This file looks rather interesting?

I went on and viewed it via the website just because I still had access:

![](../../../assets/2b270c9943dea7e3abaef197d908bac3.png)

Turns out there's a hash hidden in here.

### Hash cracking time

![](../../../assets/142de4d225e96e809d3d90bb69c70719.png)

Let's crack this shit:

### Shell as dora

## Privilege Escalation
### Exploiting disk group privs

From my enum I had already found that *dora* is part of the **disk** group, let's find out how we can exploit this.

I found a handy [guide for this](https://www.hackingarticles.in/disk-group-privilege-escalation/):

![](../../../assets/8af1d7b0850e840da344ee7e0c9b23bf.png)

#### proof.txt

Following this principle I got `proof.txt` super easily:

![](../../../assets/3d2b4f7094009363c8df297d2da03da7.png)

But seeing as we actually need *root* access to pass the exam we will have to escalate privileges somehow.

### Post-Exploitation

The actual intended route to getting *root* is as follows:

![](../../../assets/945b01c9384666bf66ccf0cf5ac3d4a0.png)

We get the *root* hash, time to crack it and escalate privs.
