## 25/TCP - SMTP

## Gobuster

No significant output. I then went to the website and found a login page which was inaccessible unless I added the `teams.` subdomain in the `/etc/hosts` file:

We get a **JetBrains TeamCity** login screen. I looked the version up as well as any sort of default credentials.

# Initial Foothold

## Manual Exploitation - FAIL

I started looking for an exploit that would match this version 

>[!note]
>While I found multiple CVE's for this version and the ones after, only **CVE-2024-27198** seemed to work in this case.

![](../../../assets/9ca121881592b160e1fd83d431749f65.png)

![](../../../assets/e018b94aed706f8785acf4cb6a067b81.png)

Yet again for whatever reason the manual exploitation didn't work, eventhough I was *literally* following the *OffSec* walkthrough at this point:

![](../../../assets/b9f1e991ab64ac5dc73640c8d8908383.png)

![](../../../assets/9e412aca8c0b65457ab41118894454e5.png)


## Automated Exploitation

![](../../../assets/835d3f1e7a99cfb2ee7dfe6e5a221059.png)

Then we set all the options as follows:

![](../../../assets/4c7bf4a84e8af8b68395cfaba58915f2.png)

We can upgrade our shell again:

## Lateral Movement

We now need to move laterally to some other user. Let's enumerate our environment.

![](../../../assets/afb0fdec2a44a99b7462e0b973438dc1.png)

We found a bunch of `.git` repo's, 

>[!note]
>We'll write a simple `for` loop that queries the latest 3 commit messages in each repository. We want to see if we can find patterns in the commit message style of users in the `freelancers` group. If there's a pattern, it's easy to look for messages that **don't** follow that pattern.

```bash
for i in `ls /srv/git/freelancers/`; do 
   cd /srv/git/freelancers/$i
   git --no-pager log --abbrev-commit -n3
   cd /srv/git 
done
```

![](../../../assets/22c9ef2bafb039e3ac69b5b082d97694.png)

We see that every message is signed off with **WORK** which is a recurring pattern.

We can then modify the `bash` script to look as follows in order to find messages that do *NOT* follow the pattern.

```bash
for i in `ls /srv/git/freelancers/`; do
  echo "Repository: /srv/git/freelancers/$i"
  cd /srv/git/freelancers/$i
  git --no-pager log --abbrev-commit -n3 --invert-grep --grep='^WORK'
  cd /srv/git
done
```

![](../../../assets/7d270bc89b4a5d939e70d5f245149b78.png)

This one stands out, since it just says **Oops** it means they probably fucked up.

```bash
git --no-pager show 856f7c4
```

![](../../../assets/1ea1d3028c8d8883fb79335ef0022265.png)

Oh they did fuck up.

Let's copy the private key and use it to log in as this user.

>[!danger]
>This is a diff for a deleted file, meaning each deleted line (i.e. the entire file) is prefixed with a (-) sign. Therefore when pasting, we'll make sure to delete the entire first column.

We will now attempt to crack the key:

![](../../../assets/c15cf0a165bf1cf10fb56000996a8bef.png)

Let's log in.

![](../../../assets/0d21733e703a6f06f01c2f049cf65f58.png)

We can now further enumerate the system.


# System Enumeration

![](../../../assets/e5d40c696ca5893aa44f4d2d150ba967.png)

Crap.

Let's go ahead and download over `linpeas.sh`

![](../../../assets/0cd26c0b997d9edde88ae2ab27cd38a4.png)

We didn't find anything useful but that might tell us more about what else we could check.

Circling back to our `nmap` scan we found out that there was also a **SMTP** server running on port `25` with a shit ton of users found.

We can check the mailbox by simply using the `mail` command:

![](../../../assets/5a24e4494a811d6e6b235ad45ba33c4a.png)

>[!note]
>We can go from top to bottom through all the mail using the `Enter` button.

![](../../../assets/0d452f201687a6ee3024dadc4152505a.png)

```
matthewa
IdealismEngineAshen476
```

![](../../../assets/fae449b9c958e90a50dc039a805dd914.png)

We have further laterally moved to *matthewa*.

![](../../../assets/3af44faa8af453050ff4984717327dc3.png)

But unfortunately we could *STILL* not run `sudo -l`.

We do find something interesting in the `/home` directory:

![](../../../assets/bb3eb0e4dad41ff9f72d9120fa38bc9d.png)

There seems to be a hidden file?

![](../../../assets/42792dbea2aca8e8fec6d72922f6252d.png)

Nice lol.

```
"dach"?
RefriedScabbedWasting502
```

# Privilege Escalation

But who is this *Dach*? I decided to once again check my mailbox as *matthewa*.

![](../../../assets/9653ce96b818083dbbdf9ea061f47169.png)

Turns out it's the *briand* user, and by the way he's talking in the message he seems to be a higher positioned dude.

Time to escalate privileges.

![](../../../assets/2869ce2f016186aaed7c85f9c6df9ce3.png)

![](../../../assets/00b24e89fbfa149cdd1b3caec0b3af2a.png)

Turns out this is indeed an Administrator with NOPASSWD privileges on the `systemctl` binary. Unfortunately for us it only checks the server status which on itself isn't a valid PrivEsc vector.

*However* we can check the systemctl version by using `systemd --version`.

![](../../../assets/96c625baff0866995afbd5045e893010.png)

Perhaps we can find a CVE for this version?

![](../../../assets/98fc02a0d78239b22956b59b60c11bc4.png)

![](../../../assets/6bc6310be66f1057f9ae53e47bdaa824.png)

So we need to check for exploits below `247`.

![](../../../assets/b9b5e42eb709d80832fd06772b9b7f67.png)

So basically we issue the command, then go ahead and issue `!sh` and we become `root`?

![](../../../assets/eea15bd3719af59d3f2d277044ec451f.png)

I guess it really is as simple as that.
