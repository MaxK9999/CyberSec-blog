### 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/807d19c7020e43d38dd4bc12c3da84d4.png)

that's it nothing else

### 8098/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/d3126849362a9169b50f3f8de1f21030.png)

Clicking on the second button redirects us to the `33333` port:

![](../../../assets/bfc3bf63b5574a08f967eee15060b606.png)

Let's open up `burp` to see what's happening underneath

![](../../../assets/cdb08c814c7f3e1109f90a533c219c61.png)

It's sending a `GET` request to a completely different IP, let's see what happens when we change the host to `nickel` instead.

![](../../../assets/d778e319ddf53376ea042ca6644a7841.png)

### Curl

I couldn't for the life of me figure out why it wouldn't send anything so I switched to `curl`:

![](../../../assets/d87f0935f005745879a289b5b195ca96.png)

I tried both `GET` and `POST` requests.

We get a `411` request which means **Length Required**:

![](../../../assets/7d9d4cd1780a4024e18786f2c0dfd34c.png)

We need to supply the `Content-Length` header in this case to get any info:

![](../../../assets/a5d7ef8ef69c475b57bcdd773f8d8c92.png)

### Password Spray

Awesome! We get what appears to be credentials:

```
ariah
Tm93aXNlU2xvb3BUaGVvcnkxMzkK
```

However it didn't seem particularly useful?

![](../../../assets/2867e9eb3b3de62b2596bb9a33bbd88f.png)

Which means that it is HIGHLY LIKELY encoded with what appears to be `base64`:

![](../../../assets/edecdaf50483baca4829443878836d55.png)

```
ariah
NowiseSloopTheory139
```

![](../../../assets/03798aa01c9319b7d13c04bdc8d07c90.png)

### 21/TCP - FTP

Awesome, we should definitely use it on `ssh` then, but I'll check out FTP first to see whether it might contain anything juicy.

![](../../../assets/1638bbe85457b34b8941b1796bacd677.png)

![](../../../assets/dee8eda858efd445d8678a44027b18a7.png)

### John

Time to crack this badboy open:

![](../../../assets/ceba71f5c84bb566a2a629af2c4d1091.png)

![](../../../assets/347a2459aea8f83a32e45a2f53ae93b6.png)

Doesn't seem super useful right now.

## Foothold
### SSH as ariah

![](../../../assets/c66b84985ba735609dd06b99a00cbf7e.png)

From here we can get `local.txt` right away.

### local.txt

![](../../../assets/bbaf2c3111979a0edd1a1f0fb61d67e5.png)

## Enumeration

![](../../../assets/b7b29141ebffcb19db43daae5e89aafd.png)

Unfortunately I don't find anything extraordinarily useful.

## Privilege Escalation
### RCE via Endpoint - Adding to Admin

We return to the contents that we found inside the `.pdf` document, especially this line:

![](../../../assets/930296498b0c44b54fdf197178f90793.png)

After some research I found that we could actually use this endpoint to issue commands (du'uh).

![](../../../assets/f5bba2f7614c01c5a4122a650b92abe1.png)

:::note
We could've also done this using `curl` in `cmd` but I prefer `powershell`.
:::

Using this premise we can give ourselves a privileged reverse shell:

![](../../../assets/02379e90c896c1be9e9cd7718cdd3f5d.png)

![](../../../assets/0f4e51842273b3bd955a64181666285d.png)

### proof.txt

![](../../../assets/efea24c69e87d6f17819b8dd72644826.png)

## ALTERNATIVE EXPLOITATION
### Pop INSTANT SYSTEM shell

Only afterwards did I realize that we had *SYSTEM* basically from the start if we connected the dots:

![](../../../assets/b206f62cba16b9e32547c122691d9123.png)

This means that from here I just had to insert the payload and catch the shell:

![](../../../assets/60e585fad9bf3dfef15abed6ad4cb5af.png)

![](../../../assets/062b6de4ee1b964d5a9a11d85e690623.png)

:::summary
In hindsight SUPER EASY box, made it harder than it was.
Exploitation was super fun, didn't really learn anything new apart from honing enumeration skills.
