## Nmap recon

As always we start off with a bit of active recon.

As we see above we have multiple ports open on a `Windows` machine. Right away we see that we are dealing with `Windows 7 Professional 7601`, meaning that the OS is quite outdated.
Since the machine is called `Blue` as well, this is probably hinting at us having to exploit the `Eternal Blue` exploit, aka `MS17-010`.

## Exploitation

### Metasploit
Since we are dealing with a machine which is vulnerable to the `Eternal Blue` exploit we will have to fire up `Metasploit` using `msfconsole` in order to rapidly walk through it. 

After firing up `Metasploit`, we simply use the following commands:

```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

After this, set up the `RHOSTS` and `LHOST` and the rest should already be set up correctly.
Hereafter just run `exploit` or `run` and let it do it's work, it might take multiple tries to configure a shell correctly.

After we get the `meterpreter` shell we now need to issue the `shell` command in order to gain  a `powershell` shell.

### user.txt
Since the only user besides the `Administrator` seems to be `haris` we'll just check his folders:

And just like that, easy peasy.

```



### root.txt
Fairly straightforward stuff, since we're already root, we can just go ahead and find the flag in the `Desktop` directory of the `Administrator` user.
