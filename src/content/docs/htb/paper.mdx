### 80/TCP - HTTP

![](../../../assets/dcb71800b6041537de7d77575076afec.png)

There really is nothing here, time for `feroxbuster` to do its thing.

Unfortunately apart from a bunch of `/manual/` endpoints we don't find anything useful, let's check `443`:

![](../../../assets/e9f59c61f5a6d2a6e326fca62b48cd46.png)

Since this didn't tell us anything I decided to check the response headers:

![](../../../assets/e7a40cc18dbe0da280c9f29c5f760c68.png)

I found an `X-Backend-Server` header with the `office.paper` variable. I decided to add it to my `/etc/hosts` list as this was HIGHLY LIKELY a subdomain.

![](../../../assets/7354acc2b243a41cc7720faaf19610fa.png)

Correct indeed! Let's check the tech stack:

![](../../../assets/f1dd59808670e7be8d35b5ad8e2f7eef.png)

It's running **WordPress 5.2.3**, let's see if it's vulnerable.

![](../../../assets/337d659e7261b2a5a79504602a1ade20.png)

It is vulnerable, let's see if this is what we need to find.

![](../../../assets/9367ff69807fc0f3020254539ffe4653.png)

According to above comment it looks like it is the correct CVE, let's exploit it.

![](../../../assets/403d80b97bc011c8456aebf5b77476ae.png)

![](../../../assets/cd3c1e07191e9f0f3c1ed0db93756617.png)

I went ahead and registered a new account via the found URL:

### LFI

This was all fun and games but I had no access to the admin panel, so I decided to check what I could get from the bot:

![](../../../assets/a7de56ea1f3776d5da80306c62752bad.png)

I was able to list files from the `/sales/` directory.

However I was *also* able to get the contents from the `/` directory.

![](../../../assets/42d3a99ea97d2bc9feaeb9564b7bef91.png)

Even better news:

![](../../../assets/35250b22d62f22c7fa2787f0484eae33.png)
![](../../../assets/c6ed095b74b8f074f6298e66f487ce27.png)

Let's check out *dwight*'s `/home` directory.

![](../../../assets/cb9c69f1b85822a8a5142e078fb7d91c.png)

Even though I had access, I unfortunately did *not* find a `.ssh` key here nor could I read the `user.txt` file yet.

However I noticed the `/hubot` directory, and checked it out:

![](../../../assets/a4f7caddc85e11e352ca7eeceab3ef00.png)

In here I found the `.env` file which usually contains stuff developers want to hide from the rest.

![](../../../assets/88d069be579e224db946408481e6685e.png)

Hell yeah.

When I try to log in I get the above message, but I am still able to log in:

![](../../../assets/2ee2ecad24d72681e05c02939d19d811.png)


## Foothold

Let's see if *dwight* uses the same password for SSH:

![](../../../assets/da39677e6180c4f7346a41cfa71bb94d.png)

EZ PZ access.

### user.txt

![](../../../assets/bd6f36934052c0d02dd53a04505503b7.png)

Other than that I have no `sudo` privs:

![](../../../assets/a623427f9c05f4bd3006b29bdd79b6ae.png)


## Privilege Escalation

I decide to download over `linpeas.sh` and run it.

![](../../../assets/c71a83c7b47976fd0560d7a18e454f0e.png)

I noticed this one which I haven't seen before amongst the suggestions, let's check it out.

Let's verify the version of `polkit` running:

![](../../../assets/5cc87753423a8f2c4694d7a9d310cbb1.png)

I found a script that should automatically do this:

![](../../../assets/637e464bc39d6a3837acdd02f2681a17.png)

![](../../../assets/5336b673d05e1976e88d8dc35f61d6d6.png)

Hell yeah.

### root.txt
