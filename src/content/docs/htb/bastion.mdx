Seems like we're dealing with `Windows Server 2016 Standard`.

>Task 1: How many TCP ports are open on the remote host?
>A: 4, in this case the 4 open ports are `135, 139, 445, 5985`


==SMBclient==
We've noticed that `SMB` is running on port `445`, we can now go ahead and try to login using `smbclient`. 

```bash
smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.134
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.134

```

We see a `sharename` called `Backups` which does not seem to be common, let's check it out.

>Task 2: What is the name of non-standard SMB share on Blocky?
>A: Backups

After some browsing around we find this:

![](../../../assets/ef9548223d31465f835544f40e563ba8.png)

`.vhd` files are backups of the filesystem from a `Physical or Virtual Machine`. Since these files are quite large we'll need to shift to a `Windows VM`. In this case I downloaded a [Windows 11 VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/). Alternatively you can also go ahead and find any other `Windows ISO files you prefer`.

>Task 3: What is the file extension of the two most interesting files on the share?
>A: vhd

## Intel Gathering

To login I just used `SPACE - SPACE` and got right in.
![](../../../assets/f0c73a87f9c573f46d6b73a982789068.png)

Next we want to navigate to the files we've previously seen.

![](../../../assets/46715b25ea6ebebc09795bf4c630467e.png)

We want to `Open Archive` the second from the top `.vhd file`. To do this I used `7Zip`.

![](../../../assets/578b1a6dcc87cf2c1f2385f122689a76.png)

We need to retrieve the so called `SAM and SYSTEM hives`. SAM (Security Account Manager) is a file on Windows used as a database to store hashes for the users on Windows. These are located at `C:\WIndows\System32\config\SAM` and `C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`.

We can find these in the `config folder` within the archive.

```
\\10.10.10.134\Backups\WindowsImageBackup\L4mpje-PC\Backup 2019-02-22 124351\9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd\Windows\System32\config\
```

We then find the necessary files here:

![](../../../assets/a059694c000ef0b451773feca851746b.png)
 
Right click on `SAM` & `SYSTEM` and then choose `Copy to` your preferred local location, I chose dekstop:

![](../../../assets/85f79c0e168d7a4364868bebc9341bc4.png)

>Task 4: Two files are needed from a Windows machine are needed to dump it's user hashes. One is `SAM`. What is the other?
>A: `SYSTEM`

After this we want to copy these files over to our `Kali VM` in order to exploit them.

==samdump==
In order to copy the files over you can use any sort of tooling, I just chose to `drag and drop` them to my `Kali VM`

![](../../../assets/505073a7451c8db0070b46c7883f50cc.png)

Now we can start exploiting these files

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ samdump2 SYSTEM SAM
*disabled* Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
*disabled* Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
L4mpje:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:26112010952d963c8dc4217daec986d9:::
```

And just like that we got the hash for `L4mpje` as well as the `Administrator`. We are dealing with `NTLM` hashes here which we can exploit using [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/).

![](../../../assets/16736ed0b347c8d3474c6a492c73249f.png)

It seems the `Admin` password doesn't show any result, but `L4mpje` has `bureaulampje` as his password.

>Task 5: What is the password for user L4mpje?
>A: `bureaulampje`

Using these creds we can now log in to `SSH`


## Flags

==user.txt==
After logging into `SSH` we are greeted with the following:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh L4mpje@10.10.10.134        
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.134 (10.10.10.134)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:2ZbIDKRPlngECX1WSMqnucdOWthIaPG7wQ6mBReac7M.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.134' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
L4mpje@10.10.10.134's password:

(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

l4mpje@BASTION C:\Users\L4mpje>  
```

Now we can find the `user.txt` flag inside the `Desktop folder`.

```powershell
l4mpje@BASTION C:\Users\L4mpje>cd Desktop                                                                                       

l4mpje@BASTION C:\Users\L4mpje\Desktop>type user.txt                                                                            
9209d6d78ffd1fc9f7ad47927aa5ba77
```


==root.txt==
Now onto the next part, before we can escalate our privileges we want to `enumerate this system`. We do that by heading into the `Program Files (x86)` and checking out what's installed there.

The one thing that stands out right away is `mRemoteNG`. This seems to be a remote connection management system that also stores credentials.

![](../../../assets/77ae5eb071189d430e711f7cc0d4d659.png)

>Task 7: What is the name of the remote connection management tool installed on Bastion?
>A: `mRemoteNG`

After using `type Changelog.txt` we notice that the latest version we're on is `1.76.11 (2018-10-18)`.  After a quick Google search we find the following valuable information:

![](../../../assets/a16f836abc96a2b6173e8f114ffc5f8f.png)

To go about this, we first want to find the `config` files. These will be found in `C:\Users\L4mpje\AppData\Roaming\mRemoteNG>`. Afterwards we want to copy these config files over to ourselves.

![](../../../assets/fc10ed87a608f3f03e508caf612c6c7b.png)

>Task 8: What is the name of the file that `mRemoteNG` uses to store encrypted user passwords?
>A: `confCons.xml`

Now that that is done we can open the config file by running the `mRemoteNG` application which we can [download here](https://mremoteng.org/download).
If all goes accordingly it should look somewhat like this:

![](../../../assets/cd40e60b8d6ecb75aedfef6880ab0acb.png)

Afterwards we can right click on `Connections` -> `import` -> `Import from file`. We then select the `confCons.xml file`. Now we need click on `Tools` -> `External Tools` and then `New`. As soon as you've done this it should look like this:

![](../../../assets/171e7a5330808f96beadabc9ece13427.png)

Now we want to add the following 

```powershell
cmd /k echo "password %password%"
```

![](../../../assets/7c84148a4f0f5487b063dd0dc3089669.png)

Now we want to right-click on `DC` -> `External Tools` -> `New External tool`:

```
"password thXLHM96BeKL0ER2" 
```

The above should pop up inside of a `CMD` window.
Now we should be able to `SSH` into the machine as `Administrator` using the newly acquired password.

>Task 9: What is the administrator's password?
>A: thXLHM96BeKL0ER2

![](../../../assets/40595618a5e009a735618281ac757bc3.png)
