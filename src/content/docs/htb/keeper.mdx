10.10.11.227
```
## Nmap recon

As always we go ahead and start off with an `nmap` scan.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap 10.10.11.227

PORT   STATE SERVICE

80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.35 seconds
```

The `quick nmap scan` shows us 2 open ports, `22 & 80`. Let's run a more thorough scan just to be sure.

It appears that those really are the only 2 ports open, it also shows that the site on `port 80` doesn't have a title, but let's add it to our `/etc/hosts` file anyways under `keeper.htb`. Let's look the site up to see what we're dealing with.

### 80/TCP - HTTP

After visiting the site at `http://10.10.11.227:80` we are greeted with the following:

![](../../../assets/1f7b3538948730c83330acac6491c8c2.png)

We then add the `tickets.keeper.htb` address under the same `IP` to our `/etc/hosts` file and voila:

![](../../../assets/0f3c660ed32f3cfd1a3676ea9d185f18.png)

We see that the site is powered by `RT 4.4.4+dfsg-2ubuntu1 (Debian)`. I tried to look it up using `searchsploit` and found the following:

![](../../../assets/804cbe48873953abc87e5d57df5ec2f3.png)

==Default credentials==
I don't think this is what we're looking for, instead we can look up whether there's any default credentials that are in use.

While scrolling on [this README](https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/4.4.4/README.html) I found the following information:

![](../../../assets/ca4e8736cf05bfe22c7c8732e5904137.png)

Let's try it out shall we?

![](../../../assets/a4e9a903d9ef9a339ba382019734c35b.png)

And...

![](../../../assets/982a461dbd4bc2b0dcc0cdf27649e3b1.png)

Looks like someone forgot to change the default credentials...

After glancing over the site I found the following information that seemed interesting. I found 2 users on the site, namely `root` the one we're logged in as, and `Inorgaard`:

![](../../../assets/55b97565a64e07dd06665d9df22a98af.png)

Let's take a look at the `Inorgaard` user:

![](../../../assets/0edc5164c67fef17099b6f4182c55fa9.png)


After clicking the `New ticket in` button we see this message:

![](../../../assets/3f423e5fe97930c2ad644cc7836da6e5.png)

Well well well, after clicking the link we see this:

![](../../../assets/c4c9fd745e0d0b7367e8ee690dce7c6f.png)

I don't think it will be useful to us, but good to know that it might be possible anyways.

### 22/TCP -SSH

We gained new `login credentials`. Let's try to log into `SSH` using these creds.

```
lnorgaard
Welcome2023!
```

![](../../../assets/38dac4443a39399546ce3b2bb4b48b8a.png)

Easy peasy...

Now let's get those flags

### user.txt
After logging into `SSH` we can now get to capturing flags. 

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh lnorgaard@10.10.11.227  
The authenticity of host '10.10.11.227 (10.10.11.227)' can't be established.

```

Unfortunately enough we notice that we cannot check `sudo privileges using sudo -l`.
I guess we'll have to try other ways.

## Privilege Escalation
Since we cannot run `sudo -l` and do it the easy way, we'll have to look around further first.
After `ls -l` on the current directory we notice there's a `.zip` file. Let's unzip it and check what's in there.

![](../../../assets/1f4d38cc1686f9273431f2f549b7257a.png)

Looks like there's some `passcodes` inside the `KeePass files`. 
Apparently there's a ready-made `CVE` for us [that leverages this exact exploit](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32784). 

![](../../../assets/134661d66de32826b7e8d7fb90eea87b.png)

Lucky for us that matches our exact description:

![](../../../assets/294a3bb6dec809f17a832f161b80fd8c.png)

Let's get to it then. Using [this]() script we will go ahead and run it against the `PassDump` file in order to get the `cleartext passwords` out. 
We will have to `scp` the exploit from the `.zip` folder to the `ssh server`.
To do this we need to use the following syntax:

```bash
scp poc.py lnorgaard@10.10.11.227:/home/lnorgaard
```

![](../../../assets/3d3696e093859c578f1535fde0edd26c.png)

![](../../../assets/4a28831c3514867c32946ad76cbeb5b4.png)

Now we can get to exploiting.
Apparently the `python exploit` follows the following syntax:

```bash
python3 poc.py -d KeePassDumpFull.dmp
```

We run the exploit for a while and check back afterwards on the progress.

![](../../../assets/a5aaa302bd7552dcc5456f82d2558cf5.png)

It appears to be a `Danish` phrase (recall that the user was from Denmark as shown on the website?).

After googling the second part `med flode` we find a possible match:

![](../../../assets/f8048d17669f70e0d01ddedeac2bed1a.png)

aka

```
rødgrød med fløde
```

Before we can open the `db` we need to transfer it to our own machine using:

![](../../../assets/11d3b2ac4ddf24121217ec72d6cf8965.png)

![](../../../assets/42d2d823eac57c164bd36c3b73991082.png)

And here we go:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 3630 Aug  2 10:49 keepass.kdbx
```

Now we can install `KeePass` and get to opening the `db`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo apt-get install keepass2
```

And now we open it with:

```bash
keepass2 keepass.kdbx
```

Insert the password phrase we got earlier and then login:

![](../../../assets/97c0e7c44e566a5e6576638d080ae4bc.png)

Click on `Tick root` and in top left corner click on `Entry -> edit entry` and the following screen will pop up:

![](../../../assets/1a5b7c54341a8cd5c871c1fbd662cc03.png)

Then `copy` all off the `notes` contents and put it in a `keeper.txt` file.

![](../../../assets/c6b701b8975f5d4837ec5aeee240ea97.png)

### root.txt

Now we can go ahead and log into `ssh using root`:

![](../../../assets/413431ff32da9ff4ca3fa4e8c08c08c1.png)

```
root.txt
d119e9bd34a7119d4303f8c165c28b9f
```
